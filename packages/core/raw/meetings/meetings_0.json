    "summary": "### Allan’s Background & Technology Platform\n\n- Former Orchard backend engineer under Matt’s CEO tenure, reconnected with Elliot after crypto fund closure\n  - Ran market neutral basis trading fund 2020-2022, sunk by FTX debacle\n  - Returned all investor capital but expensive for partners\n  - Currently in traditional finance risk/corporate bond trading with ex-Citadel colleagues\n  - Previously helped JP Morgan launch triparty repo project, first team member\n  - Built out Christine Moy’s Blockchain Center of Excellence team\n- Building blockchain-agnostic distributed proof engine using Unison functional language\n  - Unison identifies types with hash codes, robust to transitive dependencies\n  - Relationships hold at runtime, instances include code with types\n  - Cross-signs hashes with external data (Bitcoin blocks, etc.) for bilateral attestation\n  - “You could cross sign everything… constructing the same type in two different places with the same data, and it’s effectively a proof”\n- Technical architecture and performance\n  - Core platform in Unison surrounded by Rust adapter fleet\n  - Event stream production for downstream consumption\n  - Batching/netting engine achieving 20,000 transactions/second on laptop\n  - Bilateral batch construction only when clearing invariants hold (conservation of values)\n  - Deployed as customer infrastructure (like Splunk/AWS) - no external access\n- Cryptographic security considerations\n  - Plain crypto with verified setup when both parties use platform\n  - Can orchestrate MPC protocols, zero knowledge proofs, Pedersen commitments\n  - “You need to design these protocols… all my types would add on top of that, you can just verify that these protocols have been followed”\n  - Two-layer approach: cryptographic primitives + orchestration attestation\n\n### XFX Business Model & Technical Challenges\n\n- Core value proposition: “building the plumbing, the infrastructure layer to connect DeFi and TradFi”\n  - Solving liquidity fragmentation between blockchain stablecoins and traditional FX\n  - Primary customer pain: exposure rebalancing delays when moving to TradFi\n  - “The problem of locked capital, pre funding, all of these things that make FX markets less efficient and more expensive”\n- Capital velocity as key differentiator\n  - “How much use can you get out of as little capital that you have tied up as possible”\n  - Settlement speed bottleneck: trading platforms solved, but fund arrival/settlement remains slow\n  - Current “rhythm method” approach: arbitrary waits and risk management inefficiencies\n- Stablecoin market depth limitations\n  - USDT/USDC remain depegged despite 1:1 promise\n  - “Just a couple of bits make a big difference for us because this is a volume game”\n  - Insufficient depth compared to TradFi markets\n- Scaling complexity with multi-currency support\n  - Simple: two counterparties, one chain\n  - Complex: synthetic pairs requiring 3+ swap hops across multiple counterparties\n  - “We’re taking yours and we’re swapping it three different times between these three other counterparties”\n- Treasury management and internal arbitrage opportunities\n  - Pre-positioning capital across currencies for optimal operations\n  - Internal rebalancing when stablecoins depeg favorably\n  - “Finding opportunities to arbitrage even within our own network”\n\n### Payaway Risk Solution & Credit Extension Use Case\n\n- Current payaway risk scenario (Brazilian real/South African rand example)\n  - 11% failure rate including wrong IBANs and operational errors\n  - T+1 or T+2 settlement delays on non-CLS routes\n  - South African FCM discharges obligations but Brazilian side faces delay\n- Allan’s bilateral proof solution for credit extension\n  - Quick bilateral proof construction from “hokey software” via web endpoint\n  - Validates settlement instructions correspond to original request\n  - Creates distributed proof both parties can construct from same data\n  - “Still a credit decision, but you can see that the risks are reduced”\n- Network effects and automation potential\n  - Year of attested vs non-attested transaction data enables data-driven decisions\n  - Accumulated trust allows freeing up margin/trapped collateral\n  - “Very short term and self liquidating” credit arrangements\n- XFX integration potential\n  - Release funds upon proof of settlement instructions without physical arrival\n  - “When we see that Counterparty A actually signed a proof that said the settlement instructions have been confirmed, then we could release our funds”\n  - Managed risk with fee-based credit extension\n  - Speeds up settlement cycles for customer capital velocity\n\n### Open Questions/Risks\n\n- Single point of failure concern: Allan’s platform compromise affecting all network participants\n- Integration complexity with existing XFX infrastructure and customer workflows\n- Regulatory acceptance of proof-based settlement vs traditional correspondent banking\n- Pricing model for credit extension and proof validation services\n- Scalability from bilateral to multilateral proof scenarios\n\n### Action Items & Owners\n\n- Allan: Prepare demo showcasing proof types and batching capabilities using standardized Basel III compliance types\n- Jason: Include product manager Andy in next discussion for roadmap integration assessment\n- Allan: Develop visual materials demonstrating basic proofs and batch processing\n\n### Next Steps & Scheduling\n\n- Demo session with Allan, Jason, and Andy (XFX product manager)\n  - Focus on settlement SLA improvements for XFX customers\n  - Explore roadmap integration possibilities\n  - Review standardized Basel III types implementation\n- Elliot to sync separately with Allan and Jason post-demo\n- Participants to self-schedule without Elliot involvement going forward",
