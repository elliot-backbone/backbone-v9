 Them: Hi, guys. Likewise. Where are you calling from?  Me: I am in London. Where are you?  Them: New York. Hopefully it's not too late over there. I think it's like, what, 6pm Right?  Me: 5:33. Not so bad. I tend to be kind of half on Eastern time anyway.  Them: Five, 30. Yeah.  Me: A lot of the stuff that I do is New York based. And just to be clear, by the way, I'm not sure if Ryan communicated or whether you looked into it or whatever, but you can consider us Backbone. My company, sort of independent board, advisors to Ryan Lucius. So we're basically an incubation focused whatever you want to call it. Venture Studio. We'll figure out. We need to probably figure out the label as we grow up more. But we are four people. I'm in London, my Partners Matt is in New York, and we have two other guys as well. One in DC, Another one in New York, and we focus. On basically creating new codes. Right. So incubating startups in fintech, financial services, AI a bunch of different labels, and Lucius Ryan is one such company.  Them: Got it. Got it.  Me: And so I've spent an hour with Ryan today, and our model at Backburn is very embedded and high touch. We focus early because that's where we feel like the most value can be created from sort of embedding the culture and sort of best practices, experience and things that we've had and being able to advise. So happy to give you the complete lay of the land of Lucius and where we are on what the priorities are. But he felt like he could hand this one off, because the reality is we're heads down building stuff for the time being.  Them: Yeah.  Me: So, yeah, just to give you a full bit of context,  Them: Yeah. Makes sense. Yeah. I was curious on the role of Backbone here and a general sense, but I didn't realize you guys basically see the company, so that's really interesting.  Me: In the happy path, right? Like, I'd say, so we've been around. So we've been doing this as Backbone for, like, 15, 16 months or so, I'd say. 10 to 15 companies in the portfolio. Like, the reason for the range is because not all of those are ones we've created, obviously. Right. Like other words, we'd be running quite some velocity. The manufacturing pipeline is now pretty We've got somewhat of a process. We think it's cooking, but I'd say? Yeah, probably seven or eight. A net new coast that we've done by which done means we've been involved with the company from Preformation.  Them: Right.  Me: When the things usually just been idea on paper and our core value add why founders want to work with us is because we bring experience in fundraising particularly, right? So the bulk of the work and sort of training, coaching we will be doing, we are doing with the founders is to ensure that the few times that they do come out to engage with the investment community that it goes as well as it can. And so then underneath that is actually building a real company. Because it's not just a case of showing up and showing a few decks, it's all the work in between.  Them: Yep. 100%. Yeah. And honestly, outside of. Outside of. Lucius would love to kind of stay in touch. And take a look at whatever else kind of comes out of your team, essentially. I think that's really interesting.  Me: For sure. I mean, and, you know, why don't we cover Lucius, and then I'd love to sort of back into that by hearing I don't know too much about you guys, about you, what your email is for the year, et cetera.  Them: Yeah, 100%. Yeah. I mean. I mean, I guess before. Yeah, I had to just kind of kick it off with a quick background in Psychic also. And then love that would love to talk about Lucy's quickly and then the rest, but, yeah, Sidekick.  Me: Let's do it.  Them: We been around for about 12, 13 years now. Eight people across the house in New York. Historically, I focused on technology services and consumer companies. And I guess within technology. To kind of like, go in a bit further. I would say our three biggest segments within technology have been healthcare, it, fintech and vertical. Software. Consumer is a bit more like food and beverage or fashion, beauty. So hard. Good. Cpg. And then on the services side, that's a robe strategy. So we recently exited from a CPA firm we had called Leisure Way, which you know where. So we're relatively well versed in the overall space that Lives operates in and really enjoy the space. Yeah, we have very flexible mandate. We generally invest at the CDNA stage. But we're very flexible, and we can go early and we can go later pretty easily.  Me: What were you guys up to with Ledger Way specifically, do you know?  Them: Sorry. Could you repeat the question?  Me: Like, sorry, Talk to me more about Ledger Way, if you know anything more about kind of the nature of that relationship. Because that sort of puts us somewhat in Ryan's sort of area of operation. Right. I'm curious.  Them: Yeah. So we first invested before my time at Sidekick, but essentially about two, three years ago. A founder who has been rolling up cpa firms with sbic capital came to Sidekick. For digital skepticals at the fully dried out his line of credit with the government. So we backed him. Took about 40% of the business and help give him capital to pursue his inorganic strategy. So he acquired subscale CPA firms servicing SMBs across the US integrate into his larger platform. Typical multiples, arbitrage.  Me: Yeah.  Them: And then in a pretty quick turnaround, we sold it to a buyout company in Connecticut. Who have been, you know, looking for a county services platform. It was a pretty quick turnaround, relatively, but was a great outcome for us and Damien, the founder.  Me: Well, you know that. That's, you know, that's if you, if you, if you think about. What Ryan's trying to do from whatever vantage point you already have, there's certainly a Partners strategy in there that sort of resemble somewhat of this sort of, you know, approach. Right. Where if we, if we can go and embed within fractional CFO like groups, for example, or something like that. Right. And it's the same play. Inject with tech, improve the business, create multiple value and, you know, hopefully. But in this case, they hopefully scale the business to a happy ending.  Them: 100%. Yeah, I guess out of curiosity, and I wasn't sure if based on the website for Loose CS who is the core customer are the individuals or the SMBs or something else. I'm not including.  Me: Yeah. So, you know. The quick story with Lucius is top, top high level category is, you know, ERP 3.0, right? Like the new, you know, AI era. P really? Technology now being sufficient enough to really sort of take on the general ledger as a fundamental concept and kind of, you know, rebuild outward from there. So, you know, the relitz, the seed camps, etc, you know I would put in that bucket, right? Are you with me?  Them: Yeah, Sorry. Just. You are essentially displacing a system of record instead of sitting on top of a QuickBooks or Zero.  Me: So that's the, you know, that's the big. You know, that's the big picture headline.  Them: Got it.  Me: How we will get there is obviously in much more crystallized sober, you know, baby steps than that. But just, you know, sort of just to give you sort of to give you the story for a couple minutes.  Them: Makes sense.  Me: Investors, you know, would put us in the bucket. As, for example, as I say, like a. Like a relit or, you know, any of these others that came out over the summer. And that's actually quite relevant because we observed that kind of. You know, fervor and feeding frenzy that was created there. Like, I don't know if you saw any of those deals, but, like, the multiples were, you know, they're very healthy. And not a lot of, you know, as I say, not a lot of real traction on the customer side. But what we did observe from that was. A need to have a defined unique, or rather a unique customer icp that was, was not that one, because it looks like that market is a little bit, you know, frothy right now. So our ICP would be, you know, SMB, at least to start for sure. But, but, but very much focused on, let's call it 1 to 10 employee, 1 to 25 employee, venture backed, quickly, rapidly scaling, usually in some fashion itself and AI startup. Right. So the angle is to be embedded before there even is a cfo. So the initial GTM and the initial wedge products are really tailored to the use case of the CEO is still doing payroll for the company that's now at 1 1.2 million ARR is starting to break because they need some help in that regard. Right.  Them: Right. I see. Yeah, makes sense.  Me: That's the belief of how we, you know, get the general ledger transition to be something more, more real, is be embedded from day one and grow with them, you know, because the switching costs are just so high.  Them: Yeah, makes sense.  Me: In that regard. The ICP then, is. Is not what, you know, the others are focused on, which in our point of view is more, you know, they are selling to a cfo, they're selling to a finance team, right?  Them: Yeah. Have you, ace? Two questions. That cohort of customers you're targeting on. Are they? Healthy customer. I don't know how. Live. You are? Yes, quote, unquote. But is that customer based? Relatively healthy from a retention standpoint. And then I guess.  Me: Yeah. Yeah, the perception. Perception is always, I think, from. From. From you guys that. That cohort is, you know. Yes. May have higher churn or whatever. One? It's too early to tell, right? Because we're at, like, 15 or so. Entities, companies using the product in various flavors, from sort of like, you know, integrating data currently and getting up and running through to actually, like, paying for stuff. And so, you know, I wouldn't know, but I think we have a, you know. We have a burgeoning distribution strategy that involves, you know, vcs, you know, for example, that involves embedding in fractional CFO groups, et cetera. So. So to my view, that combined with what we're doing on the front end in terms of. Designing it to be onboarded as, you know, really like a plg, like motion, where it's kind of self serve. I think you could balance potentially higher churn against, you know, just simple cost of acquisition and then being embedded with some actual long term Partners to offset that as well. That's my early sense. Right, but I don't know.  Them: Yeah. Have you considered a yes? An M and a strategy where you essentially buy a book of business. Of you know a small CPA firm that already exists with clients? Or is that kind of going against your whole idea of being embedded from the ground zero?  Me: We would, you know. Would be all ears to listen to something, I think. But no. The short answer is we haven't thought about that.  Them: Got it makes sense.  Me: But as I say, you know, we haven't had the discussions with someone that would provide the capital to do so. Right. But. But. But. Absolutely. The idea is to get, you know, the North Star metrics are going to end up being, you know, transactions processed or, you know, dollar amount paid through the platform. For things. So however it is that we get there fastest, you know, it's, it's, you know, we're all ears at the moment.  Them: Yeah, understood, I guess, in terms of, like, competitive market, like. If you're targeting what I consider relatively unique customer like, who are they generally considering outside of Lucius in terms of, you know, their bookkeeping software? Do they just do it manually via QuickBooks, or is there another competitive space that they've been using?  Me: It's usually a QuickBooks manual thing that might get handed off from, you know, CEO to chief of staff or something. Right, but if we're assuming that there isn't a dedicated finance function here, It's going to be babysat by someone. Yes, in that manual way. Basically until it breaks, Right. And then I think the options are hiring someone in, right? Like bringing someone to do it. You know, improve your overall processes internally. Upgrade your QuickBooks or whatever. Maybe you add on a ramp or, you know, those sorts of things. So we're trying to just be the simple, easy solution that is encompassing all of that.  Them: Yeah, makes sense. And then for pricing, who are you? What are you generally charging for the services, like an annual flat SaaS fee?  Me: Yeah. It's a combination of. Well, I think to begin, I think at the moment, the ambition very soon is to institute the platform fee. I don't know that we have that currently, given that we're sort of focused on at the moment, on kind of feedback and interaction rather than an annual contract. But we feel pretty good about being able to move that through in the next 30 days or so through to paying if we. If we think we want to optimize for that.  Them: Yeah.  Me: But, yeah, so it's, it's, it's a combination of transaction, transactional revenue. Basically, in the future, the ambition is to have, you know, the SaaS revenue alongside it. I'm just trying to pull up my latest here that. I just want to get more specifics on the transactional stuff. If I have it. You keep talking when I do that.  Them: All sounds good. Yeah. I mean, would love to. Obviously, we're even pretty high level. I would love to kind of get details of the company after the call, if possible. But nothing else on my end for now. Sounds like you guys are not raising. And I guess you have a sense of when they'll want to raise again.  Me: Yeah, so. So the quick story is. And yeah, by the way, I will send you a memo. So we always write up and you would always get from us as backburn for our companies, like a two page memo that in future we'll make sure you don't come into these conversations blind because, because we haven't been out in market. I don't have one that's updated, so I just want to have Ryan update one a little bit and then I'll send our cross to you.  Them: Perfect. Yes.  Me: On fundraising? Yeah. I mean, we've brought in. We brought in some money over the Q4. On a 10 million safe. We had some money in front of us that wanted investors, wanted to invest, and so we thought we'd make it easy. So we are using that to go away and prove out some stuff, you know, we'd heard over the summer. As, I think, an outgrowth of the cynicism and fatigue from some of those very hyped deals that, you know, a lot of the feedback to us was, you know, go and put more meat on the bones, just like, get more usage, more proof points, et cetera. So, you know, we said, okay, fine, so. You know, we took some money from the folks that wanted to give it to us, and, you know, we'll be back out probably in maybe at the end of the quarter, beginning of the next. Once. Once we've got, yeah, four. Four months, I think, of good traction. I think that's when we'll. Start to come back out.  Them: Yep. Yeah, makes sense to me. Got it. That's helpful. I guess outside of that, we'd love to kind of learn more about Backbone. What. What else you guys are working on?  Me: Yeah, so. Yeah, I'd say. Crypto and stablecoin has been a big place for US Infrastructure there. So we're quite. You know, we have three or four or five companies in that space.  Them: My payment Rails, essentially, that uses crypto.  Me: Yeah, a lot. Cross border, you know, B to B payments. So companies like, I mean, I don't know if you know them, but, like, XFX is one. Lava is another payment payments company. Not so much in crypto, but. More on the agentic side. So Lava Payments was when we did over the summer, vertical AI applications. So, like, you know, more broadly. So, like, we have a couple of things to do with a Genetic Payments. Agent. Sort of. How do you manage AI agents in different ways across the Enterprise? So we have, like, one that's the maintenance layer for all agentic code. A bunch of different things going on there. And then I guess there's also a core kind of underlying theme of fintech as well. You know, we have a couple of more traditional, you know, we have, like a lending company, except I suppose it's not traditional. It's a brand new type of product called a wealth equity line of credit, that there's liquidity against alternatives. So lending against, like, you know, VC positions, for example.  Them: Interesting.  Me: Yeah. So, you know, so sort of 10, you know, 10, 11, 12, sort of those sorts. At the very least, what I can do is, I mean, if you tell me if there are any areas of interest, can you get you on the investor updates distribution list for those companies? Because we write all the updates typically, too.  Them: Yeah, I mean, we. We like fintech a lot. I think we do slightly less in crypto, but are always open to, like, more infrastructure plays, which it seems like you guys are. Focusing on. So love to kind of get, you know, as much data and information on all those, if possible, and then. You know, whatever is actionable. Would love to kind of get a heads up on that, too.  Me: Yeah, yeah, no worries. Yeah, typically, as I say, you'd get, you know, when there's something to talk about, we'd send a memo and there'd be, you know, three or four lines of context on, you know, the transaction in question. You know, teams looking to do this or this for this purpose would you like to opt in for an intro, and then we just get out of the way. Like, we just put you in touch with the CEO, and then you could go talk to them.  Them: Left. Yeah, makes sense. No. Yeah, we definitely love to be in the loop for that one.  Me: Cool. Man. Well, I appreciate it. On Lucius. As I say, we'll just, you know, we'll keep you posted. Right. I mean, I don't think Ryan is in town next week, actually, so if you're in New York. As well, right? Like, feel free. You know, maybe. You know, if you want, I can. I can tell him that you'll reach out and you can schedule time to get a coffee.  Them: Perfect. Yeah, next week. Yeah, if he's around, like, Thursday or Tuesday. Would love to chat with him, but I can reach out to him.  Me: Yeah, both of those here. Okay, I'll tell him. Why don't you drop him an email and I'll tell him that you're going to, and then you guys can arrange that.  Them: Perfect. Awesome.  Me: All right, buddy, good to chat.  Them: Elliot. It was great to meet. Yep. Likewise. All right, have a good one.  Me: Take care.
