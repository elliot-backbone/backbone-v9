 Them: Who they Write check size 5 to 10 and at a 10% dilution to us, right? And then we give them super pro rata rights to get up to 15 in the next round. Because they've already told us that if this works, they want to write a check in the next round, right? That's probably the move. And I think what that does is it gives us something where it's like, hey, obviously the implied there is. Let's say we do 10 out of 10% dilution, that's 100 million. They might think that that's too pricey. I think that it's fine. Well, then we just scale back their check size. We do five at 10%. Yeah, Whatever it may be. But, yeah, I think what we do is. But I agree with you. I think we're aligned here on that.  Me: But you should talk. We should talk about that. Mitchell, you should have the backup so that when you talk to.  Them: Yeah, in my opinion. Yeah, here's my thought. I want to do my Series a north of 100 million. So I guess if I lock in, anything from at the low end would be. 66 is fine. But I think I could get probably like 80 and not cause anybody heartburn. Maybe even more than that. Honestly, like, a 4X on my 4X is, like, 100 from my original, so that's, like, not too crazy in my opinion. So I think really what I need to do is. Maybe what I need to do is. Guys, is it possible for us to convene tomorrow morning and look at the. What I want to do is look at the scenario. We seem to look at the math. Yes. Yes. I want to get the math. Where tomorrow morning, the three of us, I can be like, okay, here's the calculator. Here's what's already in here, here's what's not. And we just scenario it out and we look at it together. Because it helps me.  Me: Exactly. Right now, I don't know the value of 100 over 66. Like you got to figure it out.  Them: Okay? Yeah. Yeah, we got to figure it out. And what do we need to ask for? Correct. Well, it's a C plus, right? So it will then anchor the A, so. All right, guys, I got to help Ollie. All right, we'll coordinate, and we'll get some time on tomorrow morning.  Me: I'm here, Mitchell. We can round this out. Now let go.  Them: Yeah.  Me: I can schedule with you.  Them: Okay. Perfect. Yeah. No, I'm excited. This is good. This is good. This is what we wanted.  Me: Let's. Hell, yeah, man.  Them: Well, it's not done yet. Job's not finished. We got to see if.  Me: No, but these are all good. These are all good problems.  Them: These are all good. These are good. Good signs.  Me: This is like how to make stuff better, not how to keep it.  Them: Correct. Correct. This is what we wanted. We didn't want. Hey. You got laughed out of that room. What the fuck were you doing on that call?  Me: Well, it would never have been that. But it would have been that he wouldn't have caught up with you immediately afterwards.  Them: Yeah.  Me: He wouldn't have talked to. He would have been know. Just keep me posted, all that.  Them: And then the thing we have to actually now do now is if they end up wanting to write this check, One strategy we could do is say, can you write an 8ish million dollar check? Which then actually gives us the room to be able to go back to everyone else and say, hey, this happened. We want to fill this round with another check. Which maybe gets people the room to be like, actually, no, we want to lead the round.  Me: Correct. So there's a few questions I think you need to think about. Right. Like one is, how willing am I to burn Nor West?  Them: Yeah. True.  Me: So that's like a fundamental one, right? Because none of this is worth it if we actually don't have a gun. Unless you're going to shoot it. Right.  Them: No.  Me: So that's one, and then two is if so, who are you willing to burn them for? Right. What is it?  Them: Yeah.  Me: Because inducing a feeding frenzy in order to maybe lose them. Is it worth it? Right? And again.  Them: Y. Eah. My default is not. If it isn't another growth fund. If it's like Norwest is a growth fund, they can do my next few rounds.  Me: Well, that's how I would think about it. I wouldn't think about squeezing them now as much as I would think about. Squeezing them now, but having them solve it in the future.  Them: Correct.  Me: You know what I mean? Make them believe you're giving stuff up. In order for them to commit to future stuff.  Them: Yeah, that's a good idea. Because I do actually like Jordan a lot. I think the rain stuff is actually good for us to be close to.  Me: I mean, hell, yeah.  Them: And that's like. Yeah, us being close to that's probably important. So, anyway. Yeah, I think you're right. I think you're right.  Me: But again, as I say, fundamentally, don't bring a knife to gun.  Them: Yeah.  Me: If you want to maximize them, we'll manage around that. We haven't heard from them in a long time. It's not a problem to us. If you really want to squeeze them and then say thanks, but no thanks, but you need to be with that too.  Them: Yeah. Now. I think my default is so long as it's a number, that makes it easy for me to say yes. I actually Elliot liked the way they've ran the process.  Me: Okay?  Them: I think.  Me: So then we think about maximizing.  Them: The correct. I think that's it. Now, maybe they're going to come back to us poo poo and all this shit and say, oh, you know what? When I actually meant was whatever, and then we'll go from there.  Me: Okay? Sure. But as of right now. As of right now, it sounds as if we want to try to squeeze it because it's a good thing.  Them: Correct. If you asked me about 10 on if I'm taking 10 on a 70 right now, that does not hurt me at all. That does not feel bad.  Me: I agree with you on the 80 number for sure. I get 100, I start to worry that it's just a vanity number.  Them: Let's be completely honest. This is a vanity race. Based on where the business is at. We're not a Series A business. And in another market, this would have been a Series A check.  Me: No, I don't care about any of that. Let the market set the terms. Whatever the market thinks that's great, I'll take that. Right. But I don't want to have a default point of view because a three figure number is better than a.  Them: That's what I mean. Oh. God, I gotta, gotta, gotta. Got it. I get what you mean. That's actually very good point and that's very fair.  Me: I agree with you. I can see the breadcrumbs logically to get to 80 to 100. I feel like at some point then that's just it sounds cool that we have.  Them: Yeah. It's like, oh, you just wanna say you have 100 million dollar valuation. Yeah. No, and actually, 80 is actually probably a good. I need to do the math. It probably would look good because what it would help us do is be able to come back to them in, like, very coherent.  Me: Correct. Correct. Exactly.  Them: Like, hey, we didn't just pick 100. We just said we think 80 is fair.  Me: Because of these reasons. Here's what we want to do and here's what.  Them: Here's why we think it's fair. I know that that's under the 12 and a half to 15% target. What if we figure out a way to make sure you have super pro rata up to 15% the next? It's probably the way to do it.  Me: Exactly. And by the way. The number that we anchored that gave you that slightly lower number. That's the best number, because for the business. Here are the reasons why.  Them: Cor. Rect. And then we'll back it into like, or growth or something like that. Like, hey, like, we've grown a business this amount. Yeah.  Me: Yeah, no, exactly. Right. You create the plan that shows that that number is the right one. But you need to have that to talk to. You need to better talk tomorrow.  Them: Y. Eah. Yeah. Okay, cool. All right, I'll make sure that's ready.  Me: So what time? I'll send an invite. What time?  Them: Let me look at my calendar real quick. Tomorrow. Can we do have a DNS from 10? Can we do. We have sprint planning. Fucking a.  Me: So the other thing is, Burton is in town tomorrow.  Them: Does he?  Me: Yeah, he is. He's having lunch with Ryan. Are you meeting with Ryan this week, by the way?  Them: Grolio. He told me originally he wanted to work out of the office.  Me: Yeah. Right.  Them: I'll repay him.  Me: But. Yeah, Burton's having lunch with him tomorrow. He's. A couple other meetings.  Them: Okay? Okay? Maybe what we do is he pops in. Is he free in the afternoon? Is he for at one?  Me: Yeah, maybe you guys just do it tomorrow.  Them: Yeah, maybe like 1pm he comes by here.  Me: Perfect. So then, yeah, his lunch ends at one with Ryan.  Them: Perfect. Tell him to come by right after that, and then we'll give you a call and we'll FaceTime you.  Me: I mean. Yeah, you guys just figured out it's fine.  Them: When. I would love to. It might be a little bit later your time, if you can. It would be great.  Me: All. Right. Yeah. Look, I'm happy to be there, for sure. I'd love to, you know. Yeah, whatever. We work for you. So, yeah, if you want me there, then I'm free. I can do it. All right.  Them: Yeah, okay. So then let's do this. 130.  Me: For 1:30.  Them: 130 because that'll give enough time to commute. Yep.  Me: I'll send a hold for, like, 130, Michelle, and you can maybe house Matt at your office, and then that's how we do it.  Them: Perfect. Yep.  Me: All right.  Them: Easy money.  Me: Perfect.  Them: All right, man.  Me: Peace.  Them: All right, see you then.  Me: Hey, bubba.
