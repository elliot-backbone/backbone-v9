 Them: Sorry, Elliot. On with the team.  Me: It's all right. How you guys doing?  Them: Good. How are you doing, man? You feeling better?  Me: I'm okay. Feeling a little bit better. Yeah, Sitting in a dark room helps. It's crazy, man. The sophistication or lack of mental health medications. It's pretty much just like throwing a dartboard. And either works for you. It doesn't. That's basically it. I guess it's hard when you're describing human psychology on the other end of it, right? It's kind of hard to quantify how it works.  Them: Well, biochemistry is crazy. And everyone gets. Affects everyone differently, right? Pump up your serotonin. And then for some people that works great, and some people it doesn't. And it's sort of like playing chemistry with your own body.  Me: Correct. That's right. And it's very unpleasant when it goes wrong. They call them brain zaps, which is what I've been dealing with. Which sort of vertigo. A feeling of kind of electricity going through your brain. It's horrible. Anyway, enough about me. How are you guys?  Them: We're doing good. We got a bunch of design partnerships we're sort of closing in on. We were building more and more of the products. As always. I'm not happy. I would like to go a lot faster. But we're making steady progress. I don't know. Dominique has more probably about what she thinks, but I think she's always more positive, and I'm always like, we need more of this and more this. I know.  Me: Well, I guess it's about how you're tracking to goals, right, Dominique?  Them: Yes. I mean, I'm generally more positive, but I also, like in the background. I went to an event last night with a bunch of founders, and I made friends with somebody, and I was like, let us run your code and see how good it is. And, you know, she texted this morning, and she was like, Couldn't I just have Claude code do it? So I'm like, you know what? Let me try. So in the background, I'm, like, trying to get Claude code to, like, replicate what we've done over the last six months. I'm like, it comes up with,  Me: Nice. Well, please, if you. I. So I want all the sort of vibe Cody stuff that we're trying to do at Backbone to create our own stuff. I do in Claude as well. So if you do end up figuring it out, share an artifact with me, I can test it too. And so, Dominique, on sort of traction side of things, part design partnerships, et Storey what is the quick sort of diagnosis of how we're doing in your view? All good.  Them: Yeah. So here's where I would put us. We're on Track to hit four stretch goal for this month of five partnerships signed. So it is January 23rd and like any good sales forecast, We have signed one out of the four. So I'm like, yeah, that feels right. As a person who's run, you know, sales forecast calls for all of my life. But I do feel like we have a good. We have. We're flowing through paperwork. With two, and I think we have another one that Jared can get through fairly easily. Our paperwork is pretty light, and we've had several meetings of. Of expectations of what those design partnerships are, which is really that product market look. We have reached out to. When I say we, I mean Jared mostly reached out to what, eight of Jared's former colleagues. They are now pushing us through their different networks where we are working very hard on getting folks that have kind of two things. Our current ICP that we want to focus on for the next three months, people that are at companies that have a reliance on or maintain themselves an open source repository. And so what that enables us to do is build outside of the Elliot garden of enterprise, but also earn kind of enterprise level respect. So that is what we.  Me: And when you shared companies, what's the sweet spot in size of the company?  Them: I. Would say right now, any company of any size.  Me: Right.  Them: That spends money on potentially have or spends money or relies on open source. It it really is any size. So what we're working on doing, because Jared has such a robust network, his former employees have gone to a lot of Fortune 500 companies. And so we are able to reach out to those folks and get a pretty clear understanding of what those needs are. For me, having been at many companies, I always prefer starting at enterprise and working down versus starting at S and B and working up. And so the enterprise down you end up building something potentially too robust for the SMBs, but that works out to our advantage. In addition to that, what you end up doing because we're staying in open source. We can just say the names. It's Stripe, Sofi, Netflix. Those are the three ones that.  Me: Nice. Okay?  Them: I'm trying to close and stripe, you know, I was like, I met with the striped person, and I was like, hey. You know, basically describe what we're doing. And we did. I did sort of product market fit where I asked them what problems they have, and they. I was actually pleasantly surprised. They were, like, telling me that they would be really interested and then wants me to meet with. She wants me to be with her boss.  Me: So between us. I don't know if Jason's in the loop on this, too. Between all of us, we're very well penetrated at the stripe. And so far. I mean, so far, right up to Mike Cagney, right at the very top, right?  Them: Yeah.  Me: That sounds awesome. Who are you talking to at stripe? Who's the connection point in them?  Them: To Leasha, who used to work with me at LinkedIn, and she runs all of their. Like it, but she wants me to talk to her boss. She said he would love to. He would. Jason. What's his name? Sorry. I'm blown up. The notes. She's going to connect me. Jason mcvicker. Sorry. Scott mcvicker. And he's. He runs basically all their internal tools.  Me: What's his last name?  Them: So scott mcpicker. Mcfucker.  Me: What? How am I. How do I spell that?  Them: C s I c k e r.  Me: Okay? Okay?  Them: So, I mean, like, these are. These are, like, the people that run, make the internal decisions, usually.  Me: Yeah.  Them: So they're not like. And the same with Sofa. It's the guy who is basically running all their internal tooling.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Is the guy I'm talking to. So it's like they're usually the ones who have the signature authority on the. On purchase.  Me: Yeah.  Them: And with all three of these, I was going to try and position it where we. We do a design partnership, but I'm going to ask them for some money. I think I'm going to ask them to put 10k in or something like that. See it.  Me: I mean, 10k is a drop in, you know, ocean for these guys, right?  Them: Exactly.  Me: By which I'm saying, you know, maybe it could be more than that, but I agree with you that the print, you know, having something that they've paid for will, you know, keep them more honest and they'll value it more.  Them: Yeah, I'm just trying to get, like, some, like, 10k, 100k something in the range where it's like, yes, we want the solution. We'd be willing to kind of do a poc. We're willing to put some money in the, in the game and because, again, your point, like, it's a drop in the bucket for them. Right. And most of these guys are managing, you know, tens and twenties and millions of dollars in their local budget. So what's 10k? So that's what I'm trying to position a little bit.  Me: Right. Sure. Okay? And so I guess. Dominique, do we. Do we have, like. An idea or more concrete than an idea, like somewhat of a framework on. What we want to drive these people through as a process toward an outcome.  Them: Yes, I do.  Me: Can you describe it briefly? Like, wait, how. How is that going to look?  Them: So I want to. I want to take a step back. Because I have all that planned, and that's what I've spent my entire career on. And so I want to make sure I'm clear with this time of what we're trying to achieve with your team, because I already have all that taken care of. And what I do want to hear from you is what you think. We would need. In order to tell that story. Because, like, that part, I'm already like, I can take, you know, lists of what I've created for other raises and pull that together and, you know, mix and match whatever specific PCs want, depending on when we get pair. But we're a ways away from that. And so what I don't want to do is go through, like, here's all the stuff that I'm doing to qualify it, because I already have that plan that's been, you know, my career. And what I do want is, you know, what's new here that we can leverage so that I can take all of that and turn it into, you know, how I want to present that to, you know, potentially a vc.  Me: The reason I asked is because it kind of determines. What we would say to a VC and when and kind of in what shape. Right. Like to be able to reference Stripe and Sofi now as, you know, very nearly or, you know, signed design partners. Let's just say, you know, that's already a step or two up on the traction scale as an investor would. Perceive it. But if it's going to take six months to get to a point where, you know, there's actual sort of usage there that is somewhat diversified and real, you know, then that's a different timing and story than if it will take two months or, you know, if you can get the stripe guy on the phone tomorrow to tell an investor how awesome you are, you know, then that determines. It accelerates it a little bit more, right?  Them: I get it. Yeah. Right. So that's where we're looking for you to give us the information of how to do that, because we're already working on, like, our piece of it. And you know what I don't want to do is have a forecast call with me and Jared and then turn around and also have a forecast call with you because, like, we already have that internally that we're working on. What I'd love to hear is, you know, how what your framework is. From Backbone in order to, like, pull this together, because that's what we. That's what we're evaluating to decide, like, how the partnership. Would potentially work.  Me: So again, back to you guys, right? Like, what I understand is that the desire around timing for raise is, you know, this quarter, right? End of this quarter, early April, something like that, right?  Them: You know, we've been evaluating that. And. And this is where. We. We don't need it. In in april. We could have it. But. But that's where we're looking at. What kind of framework you would have that would determine what raises look like for our space, what mold we would need. We would have to. Can I just pause this for a second? So let me just give you some, like, fundamental things that we've been looking at just to kind of like what we're, what we're trying to achieve.  Me: Yeah.  Them: What goals? We've got enough money right now to basically operate for at least a year and probably tap into money for another year if we had to. So if we did a raise, it would be about acceleration. Right. And the goal would be really about, you know, we want to. We want to have. No, no more the dilution than 15%. And we'd want to raise around, you know, let's say 10 million. But, you know, as far as getting our. We have the. And you guys made this very clear case to us. There's no reason for us to come out of stealth. Until we have enough progress. Where we can show a steady growth path. Right? And so we're taking that feedback to heart, and we're like, okay, we don't need to go talk to any VCs until we really have this sort of trajectory really crisp and clear. And so that's what Dominique is talking about here, so. She's saying, like.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Let me just give you a couple. So our goal is, no matter what we do and what a path we take, we don't want to take any more than 15%, you know, dilution. And, you know, if we do arrays, it's all about really just paying employees. And managing our infra and cloud costs. Because we've already got enough people to scale for at least a year. And we're adding. We're going to add some employees through equity. So we're not at a point where we have to raise, if that makes sense. Right. It's sort of opportunistic. So that's. That's what she's trying to. That's. That's where. That's where our heads have gone on this, and a lot of it. Was based in what we discussed in December. Rate of, like, stay in stealth, you know, until you're really ready to blow the bottle of the water. So. Sorry. I know I cut you off, but I wanted to just give you that context.  Me: Yeah. So do you guys think that, you know, by March one or March 15th, let's say. Your your folks at Sofi and. Who's the other fintech that you were talking about? You have in your stripe? You know, the best contact you have over there would jump on the phone with an investor and say, you know, we love those guys. You know, this is, we're testing now. You know, it's starting relatively ring fenced or small, but, like, we have every intention of working with them for years. Like, this has huge. Potential. Like, you know, if you can get them saying that, then that's pretty much good enough to go and, you know, have some serious conversations with investors about a type around that you described.  Them: I mean, it's a little too early to give you a definitive answer on that. It's a little too early. The way Dominique and I are sort of like, what she's references we're looking at each month we're going. Okay, what's our goal for this month? Right? And she's. We're building the forecast, right? And Dominique forecast is like, hey, Like. And our point is, like, look, we're setting these goals for ourselves, marching towards them, and right now our goal is just to get the contract signed. Right. And so. And once we have those, we'll be able to assess how the relationship's going. So I can't give you a definitive answer on that, and.  Me: That that would be sort of from my side, like the minimal, you know, like, if you had that in your pocket. You wouldn't need a bunch of other things on the commercial side, like, you know, other than what you already have. Right. If you can get too premium names like that to validate what you're saying from the customer side at the earliest stages, that's kind of, you know, in the absence of a bunch of data that's, like, very high importance to an investor.  Them: I think that's what Dominique is asking for. She's saying, what are those signals that. That you guys usually look for? I mean, Dominique, I'm. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's what you're looking. It's like that. Tell us that. So we can actually work it into our process. Yeah, exactly. I mean, like, this is where Elliot, like, I already know that having customer references makes a huge difference. Like, I've already run that playbook before several times. And so I'm already kind of moving on that playbook moving forward. What I'm looking for is what is unique about your team that will help us add to what might already know. That that helps us, like, change that direction. Because right now, I'm hearing what I already know. I'm hearing what we're already marching to. Like, we already, like, have a plan. And what I would like to understand is where yourself and Matt say, okay, here's a plan that is baseline that you are accomplishing on your own. Here's where we'll take it to something even bigger, because that's the piece that I'm like, what's the bigger thing that I don't already have? You know, the Jared and I aren't already working on because Jared's network is phenomenal. We have a lot of people who are willing to try things out for us. You know, I understand what it takes to get us to the place where someone from one of those companies are willing to stand up and say, yep, we've been using this. It's been great. I have all of that. Like, that's table stakes. It's already there. What I'm looking for is what is unique from your team that you could help us with so that I see where partnering with you helps us get to something better.  Me: Yeah. So. I think it's good that we're aligned currently and we, we share the same, you know, opinion. That's good. You know, I think a lot of what we do is in downside protection is in parallel paths, you know, is in making sure that, you know, there are always multiple options. Right. So a lot of it is scenario planning for things that may never occur, but nevertheless adds a lot of value and surety across the life cycle of a company. For example.  Them: Can you give examples of what those things mean? That was a lot of words, but, like, I don't have a clear. Like, what does that mean to you?  Me: Well, I'd ask you. So what. What are the plans A, B and C that you. That you guys have right, for this?  Them: I don't want to. My concern is this. We already have this conversation between Jared and myself. And we are already marching. What you're saying is, is the thing that you and Matt add is helping us with downside risk. Can you help me? Help me visualize what that like. Because it's a lot of, like, high level words, and what I'd like to understand is what's concrete.  Me: You know one. Of.  Them: Because the rest of the concrete stuff. So far, we're already marching to it on our own.  Me: Yeah. And I say, you know, that's good right now. You know, who knows how the future looks? And, you know, things can change very quickly. As I say, we've seen a tremendous amount of outcomes where if you had a more a deeper strategy where you were running multiple things in parallel, you would get an overall better outcome. So I think some of it is like, you know, network and relationships that we do have that you don't. I think some of it is, you know, the ability to act in your interests but, you know, not be, you know, at the company. Right. So being able to actually navigate behind the scenes. I think some of it is not about necessarily this round or maybe even the next one. Right. But, you know, if you're going to have venture money, you know, you might take that three, four, five times and, you know, the lead from the third round might be a relationship you need to start to cultivate today. You can't do all that stuff, you know. You've only got a finite amount of time.  Them: Elliot, I totally get the value of your network. And so on. I think Dominique is just asking, hey, can you give us an example? Maybe from someone else? You can scrub the names. Like, she's trying to understand because based on her experience, she's done a lot of this I haven't. And so she's saying, look, I got the playbook. I know how to do this from zero to one. Which is asking is just like, hey.  Me: Yeah. I'll give you. I'll give you a recent example.  Them: You're basically saying, hey, you don't know what you don't know sort of thing. And she's like, hey.  Me: Yeah, I'll give. I'll give you a recent example.  Them: Make it. Make it real.  Me: XFX is one of our companies, so Stablecoin infrastructure company. They wanted to do a top up in December, so we had been cultivating a lead for that. Top up infinity ventures. They issued a term sheet. The price that we were not super happy about. We were able to parlay that term sheet into a much better one that was ultimately led by insiders, then had to manage the fallout with the lead that didn't get any allocation from Infinity, who we were then able to turn into commitment to lead the next round. Because they didn't get the allocation in this one, so sort of managed to turn it from a crappy scenario into one where most people were roughly happy.  Them: So that's that's a good example of something down the road, but something that we don't need to day. What I would love to understand because I sense an urgency on your side to get something penned. What I'd love to see is who are. 10 company or 10 funds you would want to walk us into. And what would what are the, you know, assumptions of those funds? What types of investments are they looking to make in the next six to nine months? Why do you believe we would be a good fit there? And then what types of metrics and information should I be driving for now with Jared to get us there? Because. Because right now, like, I've seen that play as well, and. You know, for when you're in a, you know, you're in need of a bridge round or something along those lines, like, you know, somebody who's done it before is helpful. You know, we have a lot of people in our network who have done those pieces before, so that's not actually that's not a problem that we have today. The thing that we potentially would love to have that we don't have, that you could offer is a list of the people that you would want to walk us into the door with what exactly their assumptions are about our type of company and how we would stand out as somebody who gets an above average multiple where we wouldn't be able to take a very large check with minimal dilution. What. What are the parameters? And what does that pull look like? Could you put something together like that for us?  Me: Sure. I mean, we already have most of that written down in various forms.  Them: And that's the type of thing that I have not seen, which is why I kind of look at the sort of nebulous thing. It's like, yeah, we could get that. Later. So, Elliot, just as a level set, like I worked with you on this share safe stuff. So I have a lot of context of sort of the network and the people that you have reached to. Dominique doesn't have that context and she's trying to understand, like the unique value add of us working together. Right? That is going to basically amplify our success. And she's just trying to understand, like, I have this because I lived it with you a little bit, and I understand the reach you guys have. She doesn't have that same context, and she's just trying to get on board with that. Does that make sense?  Me: Yeah, of course. I'm trying to field the responses.  Them: Yeah, I don't know if it's her, but you're cutting out too on the audio, so it's hard to hear you a little bit, too, so apologies. No, it may be me and my network. I'm having weird issues, so.  Me: Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. In any process, given process, Dominique would probably reach out to. I mean, it depends how quick and easy we want it to be, but somewhere between 30 to 50 plus firms. I mean, maybe even more. And those are all relationships that we can, you know, maintain across the team in various forms because it allows us to do the job, which is, you know, to get the companies funded. And so there's all various sort of types and flavors of them. And when I'm sort of, you know, trying to evaluate the answer, to the question of, you know, what kind of what do we need to show up with? And, you know, where do we need to be? Half of the answer to that question is, well, you know, what do you guys want? But now I have, you know, I heard the parameters. And so trying to map that against that universe, you have broad brushstrokes coming out with what I said of like, you know, roughly speaking, I think the minimum floor is that you need to have a couple of customer advocates that are, you know, willing to knock it out of the park on a phone call. The rest is, you know, the table stake stuff. Right. The team is strong, attraction is strong. The logos are great, you know, et Storey But of course there's a bunch of micro variation between every single one of them, and a lot of it is personality types and illogical things.  Them: What I'm saying, like, just very, like, concretely, this thing that would make me, like, absolutely salivate with the idea of working with you and the team is a list of who you would walk us in with. And if you can give me 30 or 50, like, I will die, absolutely die of happiness. And. But getting that list, who you've done deals with with them. Like what? Their kind of hypothesis of the. Of their. Like fund is. Why would they would. Would like to deploy with us kind of where that connection looks like, and then a list of all of those pieces that help us understand what we would need to be able to bring in. Because right now, You know, I. I just don't have a clear. Understanding of. What you are bringing to the table in a way that I haven't seen at other companies, because I've seen rounds, I've seen funds, I've seen bridges. I've built the pipeline, I've built, you know, 80% of the decks that go into the pitches. But, yes. If you could build something like this for us. Of who you would want to walk us into and, like, hold back, like, the name of the human being, but, like, no, like, there's a name of a human being that Matt will get on the phone with tomorrow or, you know, start talking to tomorrow if you sign with us. And here's what, like, why, exactly. They're a good match. So I can see that you have some of it like you have it. And that's great. But what I would want is a very clear story of why I should get very excited about how that is going to be done by Matt and his extensive network.  Me: Yeah, yeah. This. I was just looking like, there's so this company, Lava. We're actually doing an extension right now. When we did the seed in Q3, 71 firms that we had some kind of interactions with. And then this extension, which we're trying to do, very light, you know, we're in touch with. A 40 or so, I think, based on the thing. And, yeah, they all have, you know, we know them all intimately, so they all have different, you know, dynamics and search.  Them: And that's the other piece, is that I know that you have a very deep connection into fintech. We're not fintech. The hypothesis. I spoke with a VC last night and she was telling me about her funds. Her funds kind of like specific area. And I know that if I walked in tomorrow and pitched to her, she would be like, I love what you guys are doing, but, like, this is not what my fund is about, so I'm not going to go there. So because you have so many of those, what I'd want to see is where do you have a connection and have you done a deal specifically with somebody who is in a fund that would want to work with something like us? Like, if you take what you have already and then just make a, like, package of you know what would make me excited to have. To partner with your team. When I haven't. I've seen lots of success without it. And so, like, that's the piece that I'm trying to put together and I'm trying to. That's the thing that will make me really excited to. To want to do more and to want to kick off something more formal.  Me: Good. Yeah. I have to run in a second. I don't know if you guys do, too, but just to sort of. Just not to sort of just, you know, not to rush the end of the thing. Yeah. I mean, Dominique, that would be much, much of the early work that we would be doing anyway, right. Would be. Would be cultivating that. That initial pipeline of, like, you know, our incentives are to get the thing, you know, funded and growing. Right. So we wouldn't put you in front of people that would say, thanks. But no, thanks for the most part. The other point I would just quickly make is that, like, sometimes some of the value of. Well, a lot of the value of the pipeline is in the signaling of the pipeline and the fact that you have optionality. Right. So, like, there's sometimes value in having pipeline not because you want to take the money, but to be able to reference the pipeline. Right. So, you know, there's a degree of.  Them: I have seen that play. I 100% agree. I think that's where before we would get into a partnership. I wouldn't expect you to be reaching out to anyone before that. But I would expect, like, a pretty strong hypothesis of this is the. This is the current thing that you don't have that we would want to provide to you.  Me: Yeah, yeah. Let me. Let me round. Let me just finish on this because I forgot about this as well. So Oak, who I know that Jason's close with, but we're very close with two. And, yeah, the Oak as a firm is know Health, Health Care and fintech. Right. So I know that you know, neither of those guys I can't find. I'll send a screenshot across when I can find. It, but I. I got a note from them. I'm pretty sure it was Oak saying, we're formalizing our strategy around AI agents and stuff. And, you know, we're getting more and more on board with the auto story, and we're trying to sort of embed that into one of our theses such that it, you know, automatically qualifies.  Them: I think.  Me: Sorry.  Them: Totally hear you, Elliot. I think. I think what Dominique is asking is something simple, and I just. You know, I'll just make a request. She's saying. She's saying, hey, tell us the 10 vcs that you guys have relationships that would fit us, that, like, you guys, uniquely, are positioned to help, like, really. Negotiate a term sheet that we're going to get a multiple that we would never get by ourselves. Right. That's. That's what she's like, sort of looking for and kind of.  Me: I. I hear you. No. I hear. I was just given a quick.  Them: No, no. You give an example. I was just saying because I know you got to go. I'm like, I think if you could just give us. Hey. We've got great relationships with catalysts and oak and these ones. And these are the kind of people we put you in front. She just kind of get like, I lived it with you, so I kind of understand. She's trying to build the same confidence that I have. Right. And, you know, we want to be 100% on board. So that's why I'm kind of like, we're trying to be super transparent so that we don't have, like, a little bit skeptical. It's like, it's really. Her confidence is like, hey. There's these 10 VCs. They're super great fit for you guys. Matt and. And I know them super well. We've done a bunch of deals with them on other things. These guys are going to. Are going to be. We're going to be marketing them. You guys, to them is sort of what she's asking Dominique. If I miss something, let me know. No, I think that that gives the. Yeah, that. That's the crux of what I'm asking for. So, Elliot, if you can put that together for us, I don't want to sit down with Matt and Jason and have a conversation where I am not as excited as Jared. And so that would be the. Type of thing that would get me excited.  Me: I hear you. I'll. I'll get it. I'll get it across you. Maybe. Maybe today, Certainly not Monday. It won't take long. It can give you more. I can give you more than 10 as well, I think.  Them: Awesome. Man. Perfect. Give me. Give me 30 or 50. And like Chef's kiss, I will be. Very quickly excited.  Me: Just, you know, on that, you know. We would expect the majority of them to opt in for the first intro call. Right. Like which we use the memo as the tool to get them to opt into, you know, usually if they're then not a partner, which we optimize mainly for, you know, we want decision makers, but if they're not, then. You probably have to retell the story a second time. And then, you know, we drive towards gating them at interest level in a data room when it's open. You know, and then we drive them through the process, so, you know.  Them: Yes, I've seen all of that before.  Me: All right, I'll speak to you guys soon. Have a great weekend, both.  Them: You too, man. Hope you feel better, by the way.  Me: Yeah, on and off, but mostly. All right, talk soon.
