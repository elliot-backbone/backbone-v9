 Me: What's up, buddy?  Them: Hey, what's up?  Me: How you doing?  Them: I'm doing great. It's in Florida. So one minute you're warm, one minute you're cold, one minute it gets too hot. I couldn't be a pimp. I would know I couldn't be a pimp.  Me: That's funny. I have a jacket, and I have, like, a white fur coat that I wear sometimes in England. That is very much a pimp jacket.  Them: You wouldn't do well in. Florida.  Me: Yeah.  Them: You don't. Know what to wear. Today.  Me: The problem about Florida, I think, is all the American Floridians that are there. That's the problem.  Them: You know, funny enough, I think here's the crazy part. Florida. I will say this to anyone, right? If we were supposed to launch groceries. In california. New York or any other state. I don't think we would have gotten. That support that asked for a while. And further. I mean, florida.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Has. There's a place called Lauder Hill that has, like, 71,000 Jamaicans.  Me: Exactly.  Them: It's a big. You can launch into any Hispanic community.  Me: Right.  Them: Any Caribbean country in Florida, Trinidad, Barbados.  Me: I think there's probably more Cubans in Florida than there are in Cuba now.  Them: Y. Eah, of course. Especially in Key West, Northside. And the Asians. 80. 80. There's a lot of Asians.  Me: Yeah, exactly.  Them: Here.  Me: Yeah. So are you on the road or are you in the office at a computer? Where are you?  Them: Man. I mean, I'm always on the road somewhat. But I'm on my computer, so I have my laptop on my driving on the left.  Me: Okay?  Them: You know what I mean?  Me: Cool. So we can do a little bit of sort of formal work. Are we going to wait? Are we waiting on Rory, or should we just get going? Well.  Them: We could go. What I'll do is. You jump on because Rory isn't true. He last look at the contract and he said, okay, fine.  Me: Yeah, yeah. No, no, let's do this. Lest you and I use this session for some structure, Jermaine, just make sure that we use the time right. Like, what I want to do here is let's you and I use this time to basically align on, you know, a mini, kind of week by week sort. Of work plan for the next, you know, three or four weeks, let's call it. Like, we don't need to, you know, create future plan. We can't see the future, so we don't need to worry about the middle parts of this thing just yet. But let's you and I align on the overall shape of what we're trying to achieve here, like the beginning, middle and end.  Them: Then the next step.  Me: And then specifically, you know what we want to do over the next couple of weeks. And I think then we can take that to Rory as a more like, clear sort of package of like, hey, Rory, like, here's what we're going to need you to do. And then, you know, he can join from the next one when he went once. There's more of a plan, I think, that makes sense, right?  Them: Rory is like that. I think you get him perfect. He likes to see the cherry. He wants to be the one to cut the cake.  Me: Y. Eah. Yeah, exactly. And that's why he hired you to make the cake.  Them: Pretty much.  Me: Okay, so. So how about this? So I'm going to share my screen, Jermaine and I'll just show show some things on my screen.  Them: One minute. Go ahead. I'm here.  Me: Okay?  Them: Let me switch.  Me: Cool.  Them: I'm going to go to my laptop. So I'm using on mobile, but you can talk. You can still talk. I'm going to switch over.  Me: Right. Yeah, I'll just wait for you, man. It's no. It's no rush. I'll just wait.  Them: So let me. Go ahead. And switch over. This.  Me: And I would recommend going forward. I know that I was late for this one, so, you know, it's totally fine. But going forward, generally, if, like, if one of you is at least able to be a computer, I think it will be helpful.  Them: Yeah, definitely.  Me: Oh, yeah.  Them: All right, I'm here. You can share now. You're perfect.  Me: All high quality now, okay? So, you know, I mentioned that I wanted us to put a couple of things together as sort of anchoring materials that we can, you know, use to as we go through the process. So I'm going to show you a few things. So this is an example. So you've met Mitchell, right? You remember Mitchell.  Them: Great guy.  Me: Mitchell. Mitchell is doing a top up at the moment, right? So he, he did a 7 million pre seed round in the summer. The momentum that he's had has been going pretty well. Because of the interest from the investment community, we've, you know, kind of reactively put a new round together, like a top up. And I thought that I would show you. Kind of some of the working materials that we use, because these are the sorts of materials that we will create and I've already created sort of empty ones for us, but this is the sort of thing that we'll need to populate and use as a source of truth on a go forward basis. So I thought I'd use a real life case. And seeing as, you know, Mitchell, you know, and this is, this is very current. This is like a month old. So this is pretty up to speed. So what this is describing as I talked you through before, like for. Us, we will run this process very much, you know, like a sales process, because it is a sales process, right? It's a different type of sales process. Right. Like, you know, there are different strategies at play and, you know, all those things we know about the psychologies are different, but at the end of the day, You know, I think as we've talked about before, if we want to find the investor that is the supporter of us and, you know, We don't really want to be selling too much to investors. Like, if we, if, if, if we, if it's too hard to convince them, it's probably a signal that they're not a supporter. In order for us to find that investor, we have to talk to loads of them. Right. Because we just. Don't know who the person is. And so in order talk to loads of them. We have to run a pipeline, right? And we have to treat it like a pipeline. So this document will be, you know, our version of this will be where we will track this stuff. So just to talk you through it a little bit, These firms here. So, you know, these are all vcs, right? And, you know, we, we need to create our own target list that is obviously relevant to you in terms of the sector and the geo and the vertical and all that stuff. So, you know, we will do that, and that will be one of our actions to finish. By the end of this week, Jermaine, like that's going to be. One of the things we'll set ourselves for today, is by Friday, we'll have an initial, you know, target list of 30 to 50 firms, let's say, that are relevant for us and what we're trying to achieve. And that will probably be a combination mostly of our relationships and, you know, some relationships that you have and whatever it is. But in any case, this is the list of firms. So, you know, in this case with Mitchell, ultimately, what has ended up happening, Jermaine, is at the exact play that I think might happen here with us. Remember I talked to you about it last time and I said, you know, if we go to Jmorgan last, like, they might want to say, just all these guys, like, we want the whole thing with, with Mitchell. That's kind of what's happened. Like, we've, we've, we've taken. One term sheet from a new investor that was not great to get a couple of others that are better. And then ultimately, it looks like the existing investors are just going to, are just going to take the whole thing anyway. And so, you know, that sort of path that I showed to you is actually what's going to happen here. Nevertheless, in order for that process to run effectively, like, we filled this funnel with, let me see, all the way down to the bottom here. Like, okay, so the ones we were in conversation with, really in active conversation, is about 30 firms here in this process, right? And you can see so that the stages of how we. Of what we. Of how we track them. So, like, you know, I'm mentioning that there's a sales process, right? They start as a target. We would reach out to them. Crucially, we will use the memo as the material to use to the reach out, right? We'll say, hey, and you know, and by the way, we know all these investors for the most part, right? And that's where we're going to start with the friendly ones. So, hey. Mr. And Mr. Investor attaches the memo on GroceryList. You know, looking like there might be something to do this year. Are you interested in an introduction? So then we move through the active conversations. We as Backbone and you as Jermaine and Rory. You know, we would continually be talking all the time throughout the week on each of these conversations. Like, how is it going? What have you talked to them about? You know, Mitchell is very good at putting all these notes in. The purpose of this, right, is that we want to drive these guys through the process. We want them to either be disqualified, right? Like, we want to know that they're not interested. And we want them. We want to know that as quickly as possible so that we don't waste more time with them. If they are interested, we want to drive them through this process pretty much up to this stage five. Right. So active conversation turns into data, meaning at some point you've had enough chats where everyone agrees that there's something of interest and the investor is going to say, well, is there a data REM open? Like, can I start to formally review documents like, you know, and that is the, that is one of the, the main signals that we want to get one of the main gates, if you like, because that shows that you've moved beyond just conversation and they are actually willing to invest their own resources and their own time and. People in actually analyzing your stuff to prove, you know, what you've said is true. Right. Like, at this point, they're wanting to find, you know, a reasons to invest as much as reasons not to. So what we like to do in the pipeline management process is we like to fill as much of the pipeline as possible. With, you know, with interested people. We disqualify the ones that aren't, and then we hold them all, you know, at this data room stage. So we gate them all at this stage. So, like, we, you know, we. We want to try to get as many as possible. At the point of saying to us, We'd love to see a data room whenever it's open. Right. And then from that point on, we release the data room and, you know, there's various tactics, but I think, I think for the, for the time being, you know, the main headlines on, you know, sort of how we would want to run the process sort of philosophically, right. And what this is how it's been. Successful. So, you know, as one I recommend. Is we fill the pipeline with relevant folks, combinations of people that we know strongly, that trust us, that you know, that you like. You know, we'll figure out that that mix we will create or refine this, this investment memo. So, you know, we have a version from a while ago. Right. That we need to actualize. And use as the. As I say, this is going to be our tool to secure the meeting, to build the pipeline. So we need. So the two actions, I think, for us for the end of the week are by Friday, like, memo should be in shape, right? We should be happy with the memo where, you know, Backbone or grocery list is happy to say, yeah, I would be happy with an investor reading this document like, this is. This is good. For now, right? And then the other piece to it would be that initial target list, both of, of, of of investment firms themselves, like, you know, companies, but also angels, as we talked about. Right. Because we think that that can be a useful place to start. So what I'd done is sort of created a version of that sheet that you saw for us. You know, our own version. I'll share it with you when we get off the phone here.  Them: Yeah.  Me: And so for example, right. Like all I've. I've just put IDB in there. You know, my understanding is we have a verbal commit from them and there is a follower at 250k. So yeah, that's the first line that will start tracking, right?  Them: I see we're getting that. Yeah, I see. Exactly. Okay, perfect. I love that. And then this morning, just not to cut you off.  Me: No, no.  Them: This morning. So I did a post on LinkedIn. I don't know if you saw it. We're talking about what we did. In terms of revenue last year. 2.6 and it was good. And then immediately a VC firm jumped in my DM this morning. And saying that they saw our momentum and they're the principal at a collab Capital.  Me: Okay?  Them: Where they invested, and they would love to know if we're building on any upcoming fundraising needs.  Me: Yeah. This is an awesome post. Okay, so. So a couple things. Yes. So first off, by the way,  Them: Sure.  Me: I Googled. I was trying to find out that. I was just quickly trying to find the amount that techstars had invested in you guys. So I googled GroceryList, investors, crunch base, something like that. And, you know, on Google now, you get the AI summary from Gemini at the top.  Them: Ly.  Me: It said. It told. It said to me, here, look, I'll show you. It said to me, basically, Google already had your 2.6 million revenue number.  Them: You tripping?  Me: No, no. And I was so confused because I was like, I'm sure that has. They haven't disclosed that. How does Google know? Hang on. Look, I'll show you. Look. Google. GroceryList, crunch base, Jmorgan stanley. That'll pull it up. Yeah. Here, look here, show you. GroceryList.  Them: I'm not seeing this screen, by the way. Oh, I'm seeing it. Now.  Me: So this was what I did before the call, right? So I was reading this stuff. Where does it say. Where was the performance bit? Hang on. There was a. Previously there was a bullet point. Hang on. Maybe it's in GroceryList. Crunchbase investors maybe put in that. Weird. It said. Hang on, Grocery revenue. Bizarre. That's so strange. It's like it's. It's like it's just vanished. But basically, it had the 2.6 million ARR number ready anyway, so on the inbound. So a couple things. I'll say what my own personal preference would be, and then you can tell me if you're happy or not. But as we start to work together and kind of get to know sort of each other, and you sort of get to figure out kind of how to, you know, what your instinct should be.  Them: Sure.  Me: My request would be that you would just forward me. I won't respond to any of these emails or anything like that, but just so I'm tracking it, all the inbound messages that you. My. My advice would be that.  Them: No problem.  Me: If you. I think overall my advice would be that you respond to everyone saying something like, you know, thanks so much for the interest. Like, you know, really appreciate it. Rory and I are traveling for a bunch of customer stuff for the next couple weeks, but why don't we try to schedule something for the end of the month. And then that way once.  Them: That was trying to push them. That way you get enough time to plan to know before you reach out back to them.  Me: Correct. And we're also securing the meeting. And, like, you know, like, so. So the meeting's there, right? Like, and we're also signaling that we don't really need the money or we don't need them because, like, we'd rather take care of our customers first, which is always the truth. Right. So just to be clear on that. Inbounds that you get if you do stuff and you get inbounds, which is great. Like, I really like this post. Like, I'm going to repost it. And I also have a comment on Bicycle, by the way, which I need to mention to you. But yes, just to be clear, please forward me the emails if you remember to. Just so I can add them into the pipeline. Right, because we want to be checking this stuff.  Them: I will do all of that, I think, pretty much once. We? I know where we are right now. And I'm all for that. I'm like someone that likes to hunt.  Me: Y.  Them: So I'll be out there looking for these folks, and I'll just bring it back home. The beautiful thing about it is that that's where you and Rory will be close together eventually, because I study. But for Rory, I want you to have him close as well as a CEO. Because Rory, he's old school.  Me: Es.  Them: Type of guy, and this world of VC drains him a lot sometimes. I see that as I'm being transparent here, right?  Me: Y. Eah. Absolutely. I mean, most. Most people don't like. I mean, it's. It's not an astronaut.  Them: He doesn't like it, drains him. But he's great at what he does. So any information that I have from the freaking fund. Elliot, there's so much money out there, man. Super money. We just need. We're in the right place.  Me: With Rory. With Rory? I'm going to spend some time. I actually so. Of course, Rory's role in this is probably the most important one out of all of us, because as the CEO, it is going to be expected that he is the one that is representing the business to investors. If he doesn't, it has to be explained. It's strange. And so he and I, like the success of our work, relies on Rory YouTube to be able to deliver. So I will be spending a lot of time with him. The first thing I want us to do with Rory is spend an hour with him, basically. Learning about him because I want us to create that five minute story that he has at the start of every meeting. You know, who is he? And you know, how did we get here to this point? And I'm sure he has a great one already, but you can imagine that you could design it strategically to signal all the right things to the vcs. Right? And we have a whole sort of. You know, I've done this a few times now, so you know, that that will be where I will start to spend the most time with Rory. And we'll develop the relationship through that because I'll get to know all that. About his childhood and all that kind of stuff, you know?  Them: I have a video that when he was at Jmorgan Stanley,  Me: Okay?  Them: So I'll jump that he could actually see how he does his stuff, and then you could say, rory, this is the new approach that we're going to take now.  Me: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, for sure.  Them: Just some vibes in.  Me: Okay, so. So just to round that out, so you. You will take care of any responses by, you know, and use your judgment. Like, if you don't like the investor for some reason, then don't meet them. But, like, but, like, let me know what your logic is. Right.  Them: Yeah, exactly. So you can. And I saw you, mate. I see a.  Me: Okay. And then so just to round it out on this topic, because where did. Yes, I'm looking back at your LinkedIn post. So you've got Harlem, Streamlined, Leary Hippo. On Harlem and Leah Hippo. You know, people there specifically, right?  Them: So pretty much. So how we get about Harlem was when we were talking to Mitchell. That his name, right, Mitchell?  Me: Yeah. Yeah, mitchell. Yeah.  Them: Mitchell was telling me. Hey, I know a few folks from those side. But when I look, when I was looking at their. I think I met someone in Miami already. I think probably at Art Basil or someone. I don't remember their name, but I know that I've met someone from Ireland before the streamline and layer. There were persons that was looking up her and I realized that they invested in Rappi, who is in Latin America and they invested in Doordash.  Me: Yes, yes.  Them: So if we're at the Caribbean, over the next side of the world.  Me: Yeah.  Them: We could just say, hey, we're here doing this. What do you want to invest? So those were just persons that I see. We have interest, like for Mighty Capital.  Me: Yep.  Them: They invested in. I think Doordash and Airbnb, they would be a good fit for us.  Me: Y. Ep.  Them: Because imagine persons going to a country. I think grocerialists could be the delivery partner for them. So they buy groceries before they reach the Airbnb.  Me: Yeah, yeah, I get it. Okay? Cool. In future, I would recommend that you don't tag.  Them: Third.  Me: Tag people that you like don't know. Or, you know, like the firms. Right. Like, I would just, I would, you know, overall, you, there's probably more to lose by tying putting yourself next to a name if you don't know them. Or, you know, like, for example. Right. Like, let's say a partner from Mighty sees that and reaches out to his buddy at Leah Hippo and says, what are you doing with the guys at GroceryList? And they say, who? We don't know them. And then it just. So. So just. It's totally fine for now. And it's helpful for me to know some of these targets because we want to replicate them, but, yeah, for the time being, maybe not do that. On bicycle. So bicycle is owned by the guy who. He used to be at Softbank.  Them: Yes.  Me: That he's now like the chairman of chiin, right? I forget his name.  Them: Shane or something like that.  Me: I'm getting it up. Wait, hang on. So his name is Marcelo. I'm sending you his LinkedIn now. This guy. So we can get to him. Pretty easily. So one of the. Another CEO in the portfolio, he's close to him. So, like he can injure us to him. Now, you know we only have one bullet in the chamber there, right? Like, you know you only have one chance to show up for the first time with someone like that. So you know for sure we won't be doing this just yet. But, you know, for example, in your meeting tomorrow with them, You know, feel free to reference, like. Oh, yeah. And our advisors, you know, pretty well connected into Marcelo. They're going to try and set something.  Them: Look at that.  Me: Just drop that, you know, it will just help you with the social proofing. Don't elaborate from there. If they want to ask a question, then they can. But, like, you know, that will separate you from the average person that's in that meeting, you know? So yeah, that was my point on that one. The.  Them: So meeting them tomorrow. So I've literally just decided that going into that session is going to be pretty much. Just neutral, not begging. Let's ask can just keeping it very mature until you go to the bigger guys.  Me: How long is it meeting?  Them: Let me see the time. Tomorrow. Exploring GroceryList. They said street, 30 minutes.  Me: And is it with the chief of staff?  Them: Says with the chief of staff. Stephania.  Me: Y. Ep.  Them: And the other person. Okay, let me see. And then the other person is. She's the executive operation at esg.  Me: Yeah. Yes, please. Yes, Stefania. I see her. She's kind of cute.  Them: Yeah. Pretty.  Me: They're all of the work girls there are. Kind of cute, actually.  Them: And then this one now, which is Ambelia. She's been there for seven months now. At word development llc.  Me: Yeah. Can you send me the other one? In the chat. Sorry. We have so many chats. Okay, here we go. Right. So she's. Yes, it's very junior. Okay, so. So she's. She's the office manager, so Annabella, you don't need to worry about, like, she's. She's just the admin person. What I'd be curious about. And I know that Stefania you've spoken to a little bit before. I'm curious as to her involvement here, because she's also not an investor. She's a chief of staff. So? So neither of those people on the call are actually investors. However. However, Stefan.  Them: She's depending. So I guess probably. When it says founding team, does that mean they have money in the or is it that they invested their time? What does that mean?  Me: It means that she was a member of the founding team, but she's not an investor, she's an internal. You know, she's the sort of the glue that holds everything together internally. You know, if you were an investor, she would have partner, because if you look at everyone else's bicycles, LinkedIns, right? Like who is an investor? It's either a partner or a principal.  Them: I just shared with you. I just shared with you. Sorry. I just shared with you the founder. He's the founding manager.  Me: Another one.  Them: We followed each other. As you said, he was on the SB back. So we follow each other on LinkedIn. Pretty. Much.  Me: Anyway, so, so, so, so my. My guess is that. She is transitioning into an investment role, or she, she is already and unofficially a junior investor there. And she, you know, she's, she's, she's, she's creating deal flow for herself, right? Like, she's trying to find new companies to integrate to interact with the way that they will work. Every partner and resource underneath them that they will have, you know, the junior associates or the principals, whatever. Like, they will look. They, you know, they have targets to hit in terms of, you know, capital that they need to deploy. And so that requires them themselves to run sales pipelines. You know, they need to meet companies, they need to put, you know, they need to invest in companies. And so my read quickly, if I had to guess, which I don't like to you don't like to assume anything, but based on that, it seems as if, yeah, I reckon that she is transitioning into a junior role or she's supporting an initiative. Internally to look for companies like yourself. Therefore, the way I would go into it. I would say very little. I mean, as you remember, we want her to speak for 60% or more of the conversation, for starters. Right? So. So that already brings you down to 13 minutes of what you would. What we want to talk about.  Them: Okay?  Me: You know, three or four of that is your overview of who you are and how we got to this point. You know, so that leaves you, you know, 10. Right. Five of minutes of the questioning, I would imagine will be her general questions about which territories are you in? What's the revenue profile? What's the growth? Profile, you know, who are your existing investors, that kind of stuff. Eventually, assuming that the call is going, you know, as we. As I forecast it to base on this, she's going to ask you, like, okay, what are the capital plans? You know, like, when do you guys think you're going to need to raise money if you want to do that? And I would simply say to her, yeah, great question. Really no idea at the moment. You know, like, we, we, we are profitable business today, so we have no growth is not, you know, we have no need for external investment. The question is, what can that external investment accelerate for us if we do take it? And I'd and I'd say, you know, and that's what I'm trying to figure out. So maybe you can help me understand. What would you do, you know, if you were me and you put. You wanted to bicycle. Wanted to put $3 million into the company, what would we spend it on? And you let her talk. And when she talks, she'll tell you, oh, well, you know, we've seen massive success in deploying AI to keep low headcount. Or she'll say, oh, we've seen massive success in hiring a bunch of people because you can't use AI on the ground in developing. She'll tell you something that will indicate what they want to hear from companies. Because what we're trying to do is we're trying to understand what her criteria are, right? And the easiest way to do that is just to look and feel exactly like what they expect. And they'll only tell you what they expect in this backwards way because it's. It's stupid, and they have all the leverage. And, you know, they just want you to dance in front of them, right? So we have to. We have to put it back in their court.  Them: Okay? I see a point there, I think.  Me: And just to be clear, just to be clear, though, Jermaine, it's a delicate but like what you are not, what you are not appearing as is, is, is overwhelmed or, you know, not intellectually capable of understanding all the options or like what, what you're, what you're presenting is sort of a. Bit of a stress and annoyance that you have so many options, and all these stupid investors that you keep meeting keep telling you different things. Right? And. And so your job as the founder and the steward of the company, representing all these employees and your investors, is really just to figure out what the most responsible and best path for the company is. And right now, you've got Path A, you've got Path B, you've got path C, and, like, they're all great. Right? Like that. That's the positioning, right? You're undecided because you have options. You're not undecided because you don't have options.  Them: Okay? So you mean makes sense. Make 100% there. I see a point there. Because basically what you're doing is that you go into these meeting, you need their money, but you definitely don't need it. In your space with them, right? Is that you're saying, hey, we're profitable. Groceries here. We want to scale is the next level. What does that good strategy look like for you in that settings? I pretty much probably say, right?  Me: Yeah. I mean, look, it's like, you know. Married men seem to do much better with women than single men because, you know, the wedding ring implies that they're not available, which makes them more valuable. Right? You know, it's the same thing. If you don't need them, then then they want you more. And also economically, it makes sense, right? Like the most, the best companies are the ones that don't need your money. So it's imperative they understand that, like, when you get round to the. When she gets round to the like. Oh. And so how is the business doing? What's the revenue profile? You know, give her the numbers. You say we did 2.6 last year. We expecting 4 to 6 by end of this year. We're profitable at 25%, you know, gross margin underneath it, you know, growing. So, you know, business is in a great spot for us now. The problem is maximizing it. The problem is not one of survival anymore. It's of making most of the opportunities. And that's what I'm trying to figure. Out with the market right now. So why don't you give me your ideas on what that is and let her talk?  Them: Definitely. Because from the whole conversation, She says. She pretty much says that, for one, that she wants to meet with us before because. February 16th is when their whole team of the coming back. As well said this is like an intro to warm to meet with them. So that's pretty much what they.  Me: So there you go. So I think when I said it's one of two things and one of them is maybe that she's doing preparation work for, for the broader team. Right. As part of something. If on the 16th of Feb there's something happening, I would imagine that what that is.  Them: Want.  Me: Is there is their planning meeting for the rest of the year where they agree on what the, the two or three themes are that they are going to go and, you know, find companies in. Right. So, you know, it may well be that she's doing research into, you know. Yeah. Like, you know, what is the next instacart in the Caribbean. And, you know, who are they? And, you know, she's just putting the data together for the team to figure out what to do on the 16th. Right? And again, you know, that's why our memo will be very important, because guess what? She'll be writing a memo.  Them: Yes.  Me: The more she can copy paste our memo, the better. But I'm very serious. The questions that you need to ask her obviously about what does she think but also be very blunt about why are we talking now? You mentioned on the 16th something is happening. Are you putting together a dossier of high level info into the space like has the just the firm have a dedicated strategy around this that it's raised money off already. Because realistically, what's happened, if they're doing this, is that they've already. They've already said to their investors, like, you know, give us 10 million and we'll go and invest in 10, in five interesting companies in that space. They've sold that. They've sold that to the investors. And so now they actually need to go and do it. But why that's important is because it tells you that they have conviction already, like they already believe in the category. Right. It's not like you're going to have to go and sell them on loads of stuff. Like they're already bought into. The theory right now it's about making sure that you're the one that fits for them if we want them.  Them: I think beautiful thing is as well is because the Caribbean is very unique. For other investors. So pretty much. That's why even when we talk, There's risk in everything that you do, Right? So even when we talk, we emphasize based on where we are right now. But in the early days, right? But the revenue now shows that la la, wait till I get my money right Kind of concept where. Hey, listen. In the early days, it was nothing, but now we have literally start clean. We have to make way for investors like yourself. So even with Bicycle, they would always be favorable to go into Latin America, right? But the DB came and said, no, we want you guys to find companies in the Caribbean and invest in in them. So I think that's where that 10 minute that they got literally was changing the trajectory, because everybody wanted to go to Latin America. But nobody wants to go to the Caribbean because you don't find funders that comes from the Caribbean. That have killed company and scaling it.  Me: Exactly. It's such a fragmented market that it's hard.  Them: Fragmented. It's hard. So that's where I divide. But that's just what we're talking, though. Not for me talking in that meeting.  Me: Final thing on the meeting is, I would say, Let's assume that the meeting goes exactly as we've just described and you say don't need the money, but we might take some investors. You should absolutely reference that you have verbal commitments from folks already. Like, feel free to mention IDB if you want to. And again, this is very important. How you position this is and I can send you my call notes for this afterwards if you want. Is you say we're heads down on growth, we're profitable. Any investment we would make to keep the lights on. But it's for growth and also, by the way, along those lines, we've already been preempted by. Preempted is the word you want to say, right? By a couple of interested investors. In fact, we already have a verbal commit for 250k from the inter American Development Bank. And then you move on. You keep talking, right? There's not like a big point that you want. Need them to say, like, oh, great, but you're seeding this stuff. You're letting them know that this is real, that if they want to call up someone there or it would be verified ultimately at some point, it's not just them. That's the main thing investors want to know is that they're not alone. There are other people that believe the same thing as them. Let's risk mitigation thing for them. As I say, you talk through that. You say, what do you think they say? Oh, you should take this money or whatever their opinion is, whatever. Then you get to the end of the call. And there'll be the inevitable, like, well, so what do we think the best course of next steps is? It's the following, right? One. I would say, irrespective of whether you like them or not, but especially if you do like them. You should ask for two to three specific intros. Ideally, if you have the time to prepare, you would do this in advance by looking in the portfolio of companies they've invested in, and you would look for companies that are potential partners for you or useful to you in some way. Or just interesting that you might want to connect with and you would find the CEO of that company and in a meeting when they say what the next steps, you'd say like, well, I've really enjoyed this. I totally agree with the portfolio sounds amazing. I'd love intros to Jimmy and Simon at those three portfolio companies, Right? So again, it's back to them. If they want to be differentiated, they should do it. There's no risk to them. And also, it's kind of outsourced diligence, because they can just ask the CEO what they thought of you. You don't need to pitch them. On that, but they should be willing to do intros. So one is intros. They should always be making these people work for us, irrespective of if we want their money or not. Two, You want to get them added into our investor updates that we're going to send every month that we've talked about. I don't know. We've talked about this, right?  Them: No, we never talk about investor.  Me: Okay, so I can write these for us, or we can write them together. But it's another crucial part of the arsenal of tools is the monthly update that we send to prospective, interested investors in our universe for GroceryList. So we would create a distribution list and basically just every month, sending out, like a short shouldn't. Take longer than a minute to read update, but there's a lot of strategy behind it from a high level.  Them: Grade.  Me: One is just reminding people we exist. The world is very big and investors see hundreds of companies, and just staying on the radar is important. Two, it becomes an email passive drip feed campaign. Through this channel, we can start to coach people and investors in our language, our product, our world. But most critically, where it joins the fundraising process is that we want to create a series of updates that basically emphasizes whatever metrics we are using as the metrics for the fundraise. We want them to be at the strongest when we're asking people for money, and we want to be talking about that in that update. So I'll just use a hypothetical example, like let's say we're using month on month growth of revenue as our metric rate that we're going to anchor on for the round because it's so good or whatever. Let's say that we expect on April 1st to be really hitting the market hard, expecting people to be writing as term sheets. Let's look at that metric. Maybe it isn't month on month growth, maybe something else, but let's look at a metric that we can guarantee and control that come April 1, that metric is insanely popping. So that then on March 31, the day before, we send out our monthly update. And it says, hey, Mr. Investor. Wow, this is the most crazy time at Grocery List we've ever heard. You've been following along the last six updates. So we've been working on this project. It's now really taking off.  Them: Makes sense.  Me: In isolation. One email isn't going to get you a million dollars. I will say that we've gotten 250k commitments from these emails before. Investors have responded saying, awesome, I'm in 250, but they've received the last six to nine and they've been coached through the process. If it brings us one or two, it's performed its job. So in any case, I'll share some examples of other ones with you guys and I, you know, we'll build that into our process. So back to the next steps from the meeting. It will be, you know, intros, and then I will add you into our distribution list. So at the very least you can follow along passively. You don't have to ping me. You can just follow the company along. And then if you, if you, if you feel like you do like them, and you know that there might be something there, you know, and they're pushing for that, too, you give the old we'll let you know when the data room is open comment that I've said, because that is the signal for when there is a. There is a deal happening. Right up until that point, you're just talking with people. But if you've started to put a data room together and you've got lawyers on stuff and you're making PDFs, that's signaling that people are looking at it. Right? And so there is a process starting. It's, it's, it's the best way to do it without having to say, yes, process has started. Because again, once you say that, they'll say, well, when is it going to end? How big is the process? Who's in it? This way, you're saying, look, we'll just let you know when the data room is open and we'll talk then.  Them: You know, the crazy part is, Elliot, is that I think it's the consistency. That really raise funds. And you'll know from Hurley if an investor is interested. Like early, early days. Jmorgan Stanley had us for a year. That they're interested in us by the time they were supposed to close. Hey, Jermaine, Rory, get into the program so we know who you guys are. And then we'll talk after. Pretty much. And that has been some of the journey that we have had. So I think it's really the pattern that you have created out and build is something that I see that will make a proper impact that we will know what these follow up are. Does this make sense? Are you getting a reply? Are you getting in touch.  Me: For sure. Well, you know, and it always comes back to leverage and positioning of optionality because we can't enforce. Urgency. Unless there is a well participated process. Right. Like we don't have the leverage to say, like nobody. You can't me around. You need to tell me by the end of next week because this thing's going to be gone. If that isn't actually true. So in order for that to be true, there has to be enough interest. And in order for there to be enough interest, all the investors have to believe everyone else is in it. You know, and it's. It's really like hurting sheep because, yeah, we have no interest in wasting anyone's time either. Okay, so just to play that back, Jermaine, why don't you just spend two minutes telling me how you intend to run the meeting and your ideal next steps out of it would be.  Them: So pretty much as it. So in terms of the meeting and the structure that you're building, I think it is 100% solid. We have had this approach once in the past where we had our own motherboard, where we had investors that we had talked to. But from time to time, you kind of get distracted with operations. So I think the structure that you thought that you'll get rid of it, but it's not going anywhere. So definitely, I would say that the structure you're building in terms of who we know, what's there, blah, blah, blah. Whatever angels we have out there, all those information are there. To put into a format that we can have accountability on. That's why, secondly, for the meeting that I had that I was planning to have tomorrow, With bicycle, it was really more. From, I would say from a mandate perspective just to kind of. And I shared something with you, what my approach would be tomorrow in terms of having a conversation right. I just sent a memo. It was pretty much more saying, hey. Why we reach out. We're saying we believe groceries may be the exact type. Of company bicycle capital was created to fund. That's me. You could tell me if that's a red flag and if they know tell us about groceries. I was going to tell them. Groceries are profitable US Company. Billing, commerce, payment and logistic infrastructure. That literally allows the Diaspora to purchase real goods for their family back home and deliver under one hour through a network of 1, 200 store. And then the kind of pause there. And then we tell them. What appears to be the grocery delivery is and in reality what we're building. So we are talking about from the Diaspora Elliot The payment layer. We're talking about the distribution of the marketplace. The last mile.  Me: In between notes. You know what? You know when you said I. I'll pause there. At that point, I would ask them. You've spoken for two minutes of super high level on GroceryList, but, like. Okay, you know, I'll pause there. Guys, I'm curious. You know, what thesis or what internal strategy are you working on currently? You know, that we match to, you know, like, why are we talking today? What is your area of interest in this space? Is it geographic? Are you just looking for deal flow in the region? Is it vertical? Like, you know, are you looking for a, you know? An instacart type solution? Is it more on the payment side? Do you already have a portfolio company that you know, you're trying to do due diligence on with? You know, are you looking at another deal in the space? Because the last thing as well that we want is, is to be used as a benchmark against someone else, right?  Them: Pig. Yeah. You don't want to be a guinea pig.  Me: So I would. I would be. I, you know, give them enough. Give them the 2 minute, 3 minutes. But then I, We. I put it back to them, right? Like, we don't need to share. Because then she'll tell you, she'll say, oh, yeah, it's because we're looking for a payment. Solution across the Caribbean, you know, maybe do use wallets and stuff. And then you respond, just telling her about that piece. You don't need to talk about the rest, right?  Them: Yeah, exactly.  Me: Yeah.  Them: So pretty much. So what I would do is. And then if they talk about payment, then I can always say, well, finally, the diaspora Elliot and the payment layer that we have. Is pretty much something around that segment there. So I send the document to you. So I guess. We could look at it. And then, of course, if they ask about what our attraction looks like, say, hey, we did 2.6 million profitable, 25% growth. There 1, 200 merchants. And then we have active expansion. We're also looking to expand in. Dominica Republic or Trinidad.  Me: I would give her, like, the. You know, all of that stuff's great. Really. What she's trying to find out is how fast you're growing. And she's really trying to find out three things. She's trying to find out how long you've been around. How fast you're growing and how big your ceiling is, how high is the market. Right. Because the first two allows her to calculate momentum. Right. And momentum is, is the thing that investors want to see. Right. Something that's growing faster is always more attractive than something that is bigger in some ways. Actually, sometimes.  Them: Because this tragedy is always exit fast.  Me: They want to find. You know, they want to find the thing that's growing and then model that out. So that's the last part of it, is they want to say, oh, well, look, if it's growing at this pace now and the market is so big, it can just exist, it can just carry on. Going, right? So I would. I would give that answer that you just gave. That's all great, but I'd say, yeah, you know, we're at 2.6 for the end of last year. We're expecting, you know, somewhere in the region of 2 to, you know, 2 to 3x growth on that. For the end of this year. You know, margin profile remaining relatively flat or getting better or whatever. You know, an hour, five, ten year vision. You know, we think GroceryList can become a 500 million-ARR business or, you know, whatever it is. But give her the one sentence like end destination, you know.  Them: Makes sense. Makes sense. So I guess what we'll do is I sent a dock to you. Pretty much. As I said, we don't know what they might ask me tomorrow, what they will say. But we will just go prepared with the mindset just to tell more into the conversation.  Me: Ask questions, you know, and, yeah, you know, each one of your answer doesn't need to be more than a couple of minutes, right? And ask why, you know, why are you asking me that question? And as I say, You know, make sure you have the discipline to finish the call. Don't let it run four minutes over. And then they say, like, oh, shit, we have to run to the next call. See you by. And then everyone leaves before you set the next steps, like, make sure that you pull up two minutes before and say, look. I'm just conscious of the time and I want to make sure that we have next steps, if at all here. But, you know, they, they need to make an intro for you. Like, if we want to take them on any investors money, like, they need to add value to us. So the sooner they can do it, the better. So, like, you just need to ask every time to every investor for intros. Right? And so, again, again, like, you know, that requires a bit of planning from you and hygiene to give it the time in the meeting.  Them: Makes sense. Makes sense. Makes sense.  Me: Okay?  Them: Makes sense, all right.  Me: I'm going to send you. I'm going to send you the notes from this call. I will send you the placeholder pipeline investor document that we can start to fill out. I will probably take this. I will take the first attempt at refreshing the memo because it needs to be shorter. And then I think you guys, you can lay on the specific business items that I don't know about, and we can kind of, you know, we're going to aim to finish the memo by Friday, together with having a decent draft list of targets on the investor side. And then, yeah, as I say, you will fill into the pipeline stuff that you've got that I don't see. You can forward me other things, and then we can use tomorrow's meeting as a good guinea pig for, you know, whether you think the new approach is. Is of value or not. Right?  Them: Yeah, definitely. I'm excited, even for the angel section. I have a lot of angels that I've talked about.  Me: Yeah. Man.  Them: Again. SOL is the process. So let's do that. All right. Appreciate it.  Me: All right, buddy, drive safe. We'll soon.  Them: Bye. Bye.
