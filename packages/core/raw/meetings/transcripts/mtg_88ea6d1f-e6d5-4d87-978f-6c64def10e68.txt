 Me: Hey, man.  Them: Hey, what's up, man?  Me: How are you?  Them: I'm. Doing great.  Me: In the office.  Them: I'm in my van, which is my office. I'm talking to you. All right. I don't know, but. I'm a contractor. So I have a company that does contractual work for usps. So sometimes I will be just doing site visits, just to chill, to see what's happening and then step back. That's the vibe.  Me: Yeah. Cool. Ma'am.  Them: How are you doing?  Me: Yeah, I'm doing okay. It's very slowly getting lighter and less cold here. I've really struggled the last two months or so here. It's been really dark, really cold. It didn't used to affect me so much. And then I guess I spent a couple of years in Jamaica in particular. Where the quality of light is different. Like, the light is much brighter and more sort of full of life there. It's like a gray. Yeah. Even when it is sunny here, it's different.  Them: More refreshing. It's a muggy. It's like a Gothic city.  Me: Well, yeah, everything's gray, for one thing. Like in London, everything's gray. Anyway, so I'm good. I'm happy that the sunshine is rather. That the sunlight at least is returning slowly. So that's helpful. But, yeah, no, all good, man. I mean. The business is going great. All the signals are going in the right direction for us. For ourselves to go and raise some money this year like you guys. But a bit later in the year for us, I think.  Them: Yeah, that's nice.  Me: Yeah.  Them: We've been busy ourselves here. In the back end doing what we do best. Kid, you're not. I'm on the phone. With. We got to call this Martin from an investor. Who sees us in the space. We send an email. We got a call, and then the chief of staff, we're having conversation. The IDB invested in their firm, so they see us as a perfect fit. But IDB bank has literally committed half a million to us already for the round that we have to close so that they were very bullish, they're very excited on it.  Me: Okay?  Them: So I think Our revenue was 2.5. This 2.5. So it's really in the next level now. We're in a growth stage. Of now, taking it to the next level because. A million is good, but doing 2.5 shows that.  Me: Yeah. I mean, investors. The numbers themselves are obviously important, but really, for an investor, The thing that they want to see is momentum, right? The number is good, but it also needs to be understood within the concept of time, right? Like how you create momentum is progress divided by time, right? And the more progress you make in the shorter amount of time is more attractive than the other way around, because obviously investors will just model out that growth rate going forward and you'll look super attractive. So part of the work that we will start soon, I hope. Is going to be around that sort of storytelling, right? Because if you're at two and a half now, what do you expect to be at end of year, for example?  Them: Exactly. I think the scariest thing is. I think the scariest thing is. And I always smile when I'm on the platform when you said, it's too good. Because you look at it right. The craziest thing about it is that we didn't wait on anyone because traditionally, you know, founders like us. In the US if you ain't got a good network when to stand further, all those kind of stuff. It's kind of hard sometime. So we were waiting on anyone. So right now, the stage of where we are. You can explain so much in terms of the storytelling, but you just have to stick to the narrative of what you need to close that round. And you're perfectly well. Because if I should tell you the amount of stuff that we have achieved, you'll be like, bloody hell, what are you guys doing? You guys are. Doing? You guys are trying to build Amazon. Fine. Yes, we're there. But that's just the reality. I mean, I just got off the phone with a guy in China. He usually work at Tesla. Before, and he wants to partner with us to do logistics, like all ev across. The whole Jamaica and then take it to the next island. So there's a lot on the table, man. A lot, bro. A lot. But you're solid. You're solid on it, though. You're right. We need to have that storytelling.  Me: Cat.  Them: Not like we're begging them.  Me: Ch. So you mentioned. You said the IDB is committed to a certain amount. Talk to me about how you guys currently are thinking about the round in your head. Like you've said, IDB are good for 500 into the round. How are you positioning? What did you tell them? Basically, what are they investing?  Them: I mean, we met them. We met them. So we had a friend who works with the IDB bank in Jamaica, right? So he knows them. So we had a meeting in Miami, nice dinner. And we met the team of their VC leg in Washington. And when we spoke about groceries, they're saying that our platform is definitely fits investment for them. Especially the fact that we help immigrants, help the stores to build up. A lot of people don't focus on the under deserved market and that's where we're going. So when they look at it, they said, hey, I'm interested. Finally, the investor. I'm putting on $500,000 on the LOI on the table.  Me: Okay?  Them: Get me the lead investor and I'll put this down. So it's committed already? So all they need is just a lead investor?  Me: We have the loi.  Them: So the hello, Rory. I think Rory should have it. I could double, but it's a call away to say, hey, send me that hello. I But Rory met with them. They even wanted Rory to go Ecuador to go to conference, but Rory wasn't in it at that moment. But they're very bullish 100% bullish.  Me: Okay?  Them: So there's another Capital now that I spoke to this morning. We're supposed to talk to them Thursday. And so the IDB invests like $10 million in them. Right. And after they invested $10 million in them, Then they have their fund. But the fund is definitely for companies like us in the Caribbean. So they say they only invest in growth stage company. So when we tell them what we're doing, this lady was like, hey. The team is not going to come back till the 16th. So when I told them what we're doing, They're like, okay, no, we need to meet earlier. So I told them the IDB wants the IDD commits 500k on the table. So, like, really? Okay, cool. So we're going to meet with them Thursday. I'm not going in the meeting begging them for money. I'm just going there. To tell them who we are and just ask them. Ask them a few questions. What kind of portfolio you do. Are we a perfect fit? Is the right time?  Me: Yeah. Y. Eah. I mean, the main thing that, the main thing that, the main thing that we will need to understand is just do they, do they lead rounds or not? Right. Because what you heard from IDB in terms of, yeah, we're down for a certain amount. You need to go find a lead. The reason I asked if we have the LOI is because that is a very common response for an investor. Just to give you the sort of. The other side of the interpretation here is like there is nothing, there is no reason why an investor would not say that, because they want to see all the deals like they want to continue to be in the flow of the information. Until there is lead, they don't have to do anything anyway, right? Like they don't have to do any extra work. It's great if we have a little bit more formally sort of described with them in an loi, because that does kind of, you know, make them a little bit more accountable. But overall, what you will hear a lot is various forms of that statement, you know, like, yeah, we love what you're doing. Sounds great. Like, go find a lead and then we can talk again, right? And so, you know, the challenge that we have to, you know, the thing that we need to do is find a lead.  Them: Exactly. That's exactly. And that's why, for me personally, that's why I decided, hey, I'm going to reach out to this. They're in Miami. This investment firm is in Miami.  Me: What is the name of the firm?  Them: Bicycle capital.  Me: Bicycle capital.  Them: So they're in Miami, right? Idb, investing them. So I know the team. So I'm going to meet with them Thursday. I said, hey, I can come to Miami if you want. I said, let's meet first, and then we can invite you guys in to come and talk to us about what? But the idea is really to meet with them, discuss, and then once I end the call, just send them a simple memo. Of why I think they need. They're just a basic memo of what we discuss and then take it to the next level. Yeah, that's pretty much.  Me: Okay, so let's do this. So on the proposal. I think it's. It's all fine, to be honest. I think. I don't think we need to. I'm not going to push on any of the terms more.  Them: Yeah.  Me: The terms that you put together are fine. So I think overall, I think we will just, you know, proceed with those terms. Like, I'll put it into a new contract. I do want to. So I know here in your proposal, you've said that you don't want there to be any early termination clauses and all those kinds of things. I think that's also fine. I mean, Yeah, I'm fine with that.  Them: I'm not here to waste your time, and you're not here to waste mine. I mean, at the end of the day,  Me: Exactly.  Them: I'm street, I'm street When it comes to our lips I grew up in the street so I know what's up.  Me: All right, so. So. So let's just assume the agreement is done.  Them: Yeah, let's move on from there.  Me: In the next day or two. I suggest that what we do is you and I and Rory, we. We set up a weekly call. And I think in the first. Call that we'll do. Maybe we can do it on Wednesday, because then it will be before your meeting.  Them: Yeah, sure. I mean, what I'll do is. I know Wednesday is solid. I know I have tell me the time Wednesday. Because I know we'd have to do with her. Let me tell you what dimension works for me. A minute. Commitment.  Me: I could do 9am Eastern. I could do 11 Eastern.  Them: Here. Let me know by my calendar. I mean, here's the deal, Elliot. I mean, I have. Wednesday is free, pretty much. I have nothing. Wednesday said salad.  Me: So I'll send something for 11am on Wednesday, and if possible, we'll make that the recurring time for the weekly.  Them: Definitely.  Me: And then I think what I will prepare for that. Meeting is a couple of things, but. But the main thing will be like a working pipeline document for us. The way that we treat fundraising rounds is very much like a. Kind of like a sales pipeline, really. Right. Like, you know, listing out all the firms. Listing out, you know, are we in touch with them or not? Where are we in the stage of conversation, et Storey  Them: Yeah.  Me: So I'm going to prepare just the structure of that. And then I think we want to have a discussion about kind of, you know, who we want to target and how. And in addition to that, I think I want to just spend some time talking about, like, positioning and, you know, how we want to position ourselves in. These early conversations. Because at some point, what we want is that, you know, all the conversations that you're having in your networks with investors, you know, we need to sort of join all of that up with all the stuff that we might intro you to as well, just so that we have full visibility over what's happening and what we're saying and to whom.  Them: Sure. I think the crazy part is. I think the crazy part is over the two years since we left Jmorgan Stanley, Venture Lab over the two years since being with them. So. September. And then we left last year out of it, so it was February. 2025. I think during that time there. 's so much persons that we have engaged, engage with them, but we have not really taken the opportunity. I mean, everyone wants to invest like the Jmorgan Stanley next level of fund they're interested to invest. Right. I think what they're looking at really more is the structure. So that's why we went ahead and we got this guy. He left Walmart. He was at Walmart. He left it. He has been there for 27 years. He's also a board member of the fund. So we went ahead and we're like, hey, come on board with us. As a fractional quote, unquote. Fractional. Just an idea. Just come on board as this. We have a term that is very minimal. He likes the company. He wants to see it grow. And we kind of use that as a strategy because he knows the person who managed the fund like brothers and sisters. They're like next door neighbors, pretty much. So one of the main reason why we brought him on as strategics, fractional CFO kind of vibe. He's more like an accountant behind the scene. But the position that we're giving was just to activate the Jmorgan because, you know, these guys are deal breakers. They want to make sure that they have persons. Who if they give them the money, they know that these guys are not going to run away to Dubai.  Me: Of course.  Them: And buy Ferraris and not yet.  Me: Well, not. Not yet. Not yet, anyway. Yeah. And look, that's great, right? Like what. What I want us to have between us is just maximum complete visibility into the universe of investors that we've spoken to in the past, that we might speak to, that we could speak to, that we know the full spectrum. Right. Because once we agree on an approach which you know, we'll need to in the next couple of weeks. Really? Like, in my view. You know, it's very important that we. That we execute on it, you know, perfectly. And a lot of it's about timing. You don't want to be sort of half in the market, right? Like, you don't want some people to be hearing that you are maybe raising or you're not, or, like, what's going on? Or, like, we want to have full control over that narrative. And so we just need to know, basically, like, you know, it sounds like he's a good weapon, and we can activate him within Jmorgan Stanley.  Them: Yeah, he's a solid weapon across the whole industry because he was their tax VP guy. So he deals with billions of dollars for Walmart. He was at Walmart. So definitely he has connection that Pabi has from Angels. You'll never know. He probably could call a guy and say, hey.  Me: Right.  Them: These guys are raising. Do you want to put in half a million or whatever the case?  Me: And that will be. And that, by the way, you know that Will the angels is going to be the first phase of the reach out that we do, right? How we will structure the communications and sort of the waves of work is we'll start with the lowest risk, folks. And typically that is the angels, right? Like friendly angels that you can have, you know, one conversation with and maybe you get a 10, 20k investment, right? But, like, there are people that are friendly already, like, you know we can use them to perfect the pitch, right? The other thing is, is that we can then, you know, gather those commits. Even if they are verbal. Right. And bucket them all such that then when we go to the the tier 2 and tier 3 firms, which would be where we would go next, we turn up already with 250k and verbal commits from a bunch of angels that we can list. Makes us look impressive.  Them: And the thing is, though, so the question is, I want to ask you those from an angel, from what we're doing, right? Say we're raising $3 million, right? And then we want to get an angel. How would we do it? Would we have one firm on the cap table? And then it's conjoined. All of those angels in it.  Me: No, I would literally just. You just have individuals on the cap table, right? So the way that you do it is that you speak to them first and you get. You get a verbal commitment, right? So they'll say, yeah, I'll put 10k in, 20k in. And you say, okay, great. I'll come back to you when the round is finalizing. And there's actually. A piece of paper that you can sign, right? Because until that point, there's nothing they can do.  Them: Yeah. Get up safe and give them the save.  Me: If you want to do that, then you can, but then the safe requires you to price it, right? Usually.  Them: Yeah, like a price from what you don't want. To.  Me: We have no opinion like the market prices for us. Right? We as founders should have zero opinion on either round size or price associated with it. Like the positioning that we will have. Obviously we do have an opinion, right? Of course we do. But how we position to the market is that we have no opinion. It's for you guys to figure that stuff out. We're just exploring all the options that have become available to us, right? And so on the angels. If you're doing a 3 million round, right, like, maybe you have, you know, I don't know, 500k space for angels, which could be 5 to 10 angels, right? And so you would, you, you would, you know, we would figure out the strategy to, you know, who is this universe? Of angels. This is the work I want us to be doing on Wednesday. To start is between Backbone, between GroceryList, between all, everyone. Like, who are the target angels? And can we start talking to them softly, you know, now and start to gather some of those. Those commits verbally? Because then when we show up at the firms, the tier two firms, the less important firms, which is where we'll go next. You know we come already with ammunition, right? We already have some commits in the round. And then, of course, once we've gone through that wave of folks, Maybe we've got more interest. Maybe there's someone that maybe wants to lead or whatever. But it means that then when we finally go back to Jmorgan Stanley, right at the end, right, we show up and we. And they, you know, and we say, you know, and they say, oh, how's the round going? We say, yo. I mean, it's going great, right? We've got 10 angels, we've got two term sheets. There's a potential lead from this one. And then, of course, Jmorgan Stanley, we have leverage with them, because then Jmorgan Stanley might say, oh, fuck that, I want to take the whole lot. I don't want these people in there, right? Like,  Them: See the strategy here, because Jmorgan Stanley, for them, they're going to be like, I don't want all of these guys on my cap table with me. So they'll say, okay, I'll take the whole. I'll buy the deal for you.  Me: Exactly. Exactly. You can see how we are more likely to get a favorable outcome if we do it that way than if we just rang up Jmorgan Stanley tomorrow and said, hey, do you want to invest? They'll be like,  Them: I see you, man. Makes sense. Makes sense. Perfect the way I said. All right. So I guess what I'll do is. And this is a bong. The review that I sent you. I know. Rory was supposed to even give his take. But he trusted because he came over from us. So what I'll do is we would meet Wednesday, you say, and then I'll tell. I'll speak to Rory and let him know that we're going to be having. I mean, you can text us in the group either way, so I'll let. Him know that we'll be reaching Wednesday, so let's do that.  Me: Exactly.  Them: My heart stop is no, because I have another call to make, but I think we're cooking, so.  Me: Okay?  Them: Let's do it. I mean, let's do what we got to do, and then we'll take it to the next level, right?  Me: Yeah. I'll send you. I'll send you guys. Yeah, man, me too. I'll send you guys some stuff. Like, ideally, you can prepare in some form for Wednesday. It's not a lot of work. I don't intend to create work for you, but, you know, there might be some stuff.  Them: I'm excited.  Me: I'll send the invite. I've just sent the invite right now. And we'll talk in between now and then we'll get the contract done.  Them: Yeah. All right, man. Appreciate you. I was talking. Bye. Bye.  Me: All right, buddy. Peace.
