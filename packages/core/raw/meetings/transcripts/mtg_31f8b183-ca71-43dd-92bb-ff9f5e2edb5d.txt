 Me: Hello, treacle. All right.  Them: Are you, dan?  Me: Mate. Good man. How are you? Nice to hear your voice again.  Them: And yours. Your sweet tones.  Me: My dulcet tones. Burton will be here in a sec. I was just on a meeting with him. I don't know why he hasn't joined. Actually, hang on.  Them: Did you lead into the microphone when you said dulcet tones there? Because it suddenly got smooth and radio presenter.  Me: No, I didn't, actually, but. Well, maybe I did, subconsciously.  Them: You're just a natural.  Me: Thanks for the checker stuff. I haven't seen it yet.  Them: Okay?  Me: Rather.  Them: No problem. I was actually kind of surprised when I dug into their memo.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Because slight pivots. And so I met these guys. I don't know if you remember. I met them last year.  Me: Oh, no, I didn't remember that at all. That's crazy.  Them: But it was a different subject. It was like, hey, Erskine, how about you just meet these guys?  Me: Oh, yeah. Right.  Them: To see if there's anything you can do to help each other.  Me: Yeah. They've been around the houses. They've done a lot of stuff. But come out the other side now funded.  Them: Yeah. No, that's good. And so they're going to be involved with FCMS as well. Wouldn't you just know it? What was the acronym again?  Me: Correct. Correct. Well, I'm not going to say. I'm not going to say the rude one. No, absolutely.  Them: Because Matt arrives right in the middle of you saying it.  Me: Yeah, exactly. That why I suggested you go to them next, though, in terms of the order of stuff that we.  Them: No, absolutely. That was good advice.  Me: Let me just call Matt to make sure that he's just forgotten.  Them: Okay, no worries.  Me: Hey, buddy.  Them: Allan.  Me: I was just making sure you were going to join.  Them: Yeah, I was just finishing Nemo.  Me: Yeah. See you in a sec. There he is.  Them: Allan. Oops. We doing cameras? Let's go. Whatever.  Me: I never do camera. Really? I hate it.  Them: Elliot no camera. Kind of guy. You got a face made for radio. He's an AI ghost.  Me: Yeah, I'm not actually here right now. This is just my Allan trained bot that I created.  Them: Excellent.  Me: I was just saying he met Checker already last year. I forgot that we did that intro.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Because.  Them: It was just nice to meet you, anything we could do to help each other kind of thing. Nothing formal.  Me: But then because of this new stuff that he's got working on that we'll talk about. He's written up a couple sort of company specific kind of pitches, right? Like the XFX one, and then he's written up a checker one. So I gave him the latest checker memo and Allan was like, I was very surprised reading this. It's like very different to what it was 12. Months ago, I was like, oh, man, you don't know half of it.  Them: We barely survived.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Been around the house. This was how Elliot described it.  Me: Oh, yeah. At the very least. So, anyway, look how you guys want to do this, certainly more for Matt's kind of edification in terms of the stuff that you're working on, Allan.  Them: Yeah, I'll do a quick catch up.  Me: Yeah, maybe do that. And try as best you can to explain like, I'm five, as opposed to the dense version. I literally can't stand any.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. So I'll just rewind to a couple of weeks ago. Elliot and I had one of our sporadic catch ups, which is what we do. Once, twice, two, three times a year. I don't think we've ever had zero per year. Very consistent, but it's that kind of thing. And. Sorry. I caught Elliot up and there's a project I've been working on since about September. Which is when they wind up our trading desk. At the hedge fund I'm at, okay? So let's turn to this pet project. Started off as a functional programming project. But it had a really interesting angle that reminds me of distributed ledgers. And with Claude at my side. I started working out all my grudges. And gripes. About distributed ledgers and crypto and stuff in this system. So just to remind you, I've had a fair amount of experience. With both digital assets. I was helping one of their clients build out this tokenized collateral platform. On the da platform, and then. JP Morgan. I helped them set up their triparty repo system, so I was one of the first pairs of boots on the ground there. So that thing's actually live? It's turning billions of repo notional per month. But I've just got this long list of agony to draw on and I dumped it into the system. And it came out looking really cool. And one of the. One of the target areas I was already working on. Was a future commissions merchants in the FX space, so. They turn out to be a well suited client base Just because. There's a couple of reasons. First of all, they undergo a world of pain. In terms of bilateral reconciliation and settlement, like just everyday pain. They just deal with it. Spreadsheets as FTP drops. It can just bs. So I have a contact in that space. His previous life was a special situations guy. For. Each trading FX operation a bank. So whenever normal operations failed, It Elliot this guy and he talked to all the individuals. So he previously. Had a pretty hilarious startup pitch for me that will remind you of your orchard days. And it was. It was FCM Focus. So a lot of these businesses have been around for years.  Me: What is it again, allan? Fcm is.  Them: Futures commissioners, merchant, but. But they're instrumental in the FX business. So every. Every FX aggregator and every FX broker you've ever heard of.  Me: Future commission.  Them: Is one of these things is an fcm. And they've got very regular cash flows, you know, because it's an established business area.  Me: I'm. Sorry.  Them: But there's. There's no liquidity events. There's hardly any M and A activity. Everyone's settled into their respective niche. Or niche. To offer these guys liquidity events. My friend was trying to come up with a note like product. You know, are effectively a lending like product. For these guys. So in exchange for claims on their future cash flows, which are regular, he was going to create this note like product. So it was pre esoteric. The target audience was tiny. There was, like, at most a hand, almost a hundred global FCM CEOs who wanted, you know, who would like to pay for boats or divorces or that kind of stuff. So it was a really weird product. But he's got a bunch of contacts in the FCM space, so we're already sitting. Around wondering what to do. And how we're going to target like tier 2 FCMS who are not sophisticated technical players at all. When Elliot shows up for his, you know, sporadic. Catch up. And it turns out you've got at least two companies in your portfolio. Who are tech savvy. Fcm facing. Businesses, and I think it's pretty likely. That bolted on the stuff I developed. Would be, at the very least, a technical win for these guys. It's, like, ready to be bolted on.  Me: Can you explain why Allan, as best you can? Why does Jason from XFX go. Yeah, this is kind of interesting.  Them: Well because he sees all the pain involved in settlement across both FCMs, which is this bilateral reconciliation paint. CVS and what have you. It's just, you know, just nonsense. In its manual, they're also dealing in Stable Coins, so that's yet another rail. And that actually. That actually introduces another party. So Stablecoins. It's not just the Stablecoin. Itself. But then you've got the remittance network. That actually gives you the cash claims to the Stablecoins. So. So you've got. Let me count. So you've got Stablecoin Network. One. Remittance network. Two. And now you've got. FCM that you're dealing with three. And then you've got U as the person doing the transactor, so you've got these four legs. And you've got a whole bunch of settlements to do. Crypto just barely gets you out of jail for one of these legs. Give or take the annoying issue of actually remitting things. And then you've got cash settled legs, which are a pain, and they're normally T plus 1, T plus 2. So this process can be. Sped up. If you learn to climb up this ladder of trust, like effectively, a cash leg is as good as settled when it's finalized. That means. Submitted to the payment network, you know, Swift, Fedwire, what have you. And receive your, you know, finalized notification receipt. As the payer, you get this receipt back. So every, every One of these FCMs has that baked into the infrastructure. It's just dealt with with, you know, crappy bespoke software. You know, they've got some. Java software, they've got some Python software. That interfaces to their APIs. But they don't do anything with that. And then the person on the other side receives it. T plus one. But it is something that you can. Sign with appropriate infrastructure that can be embedded on their side. And that's one leg of a bilateral. Proof. And then at the other side. You can sign that you've either received. A stablecoin. Payment. Or another cash, like so. Cash versus cash is called PvP. Payment versus payments. And. Stablecoins. Cash is. I think that's just called stablecoin, Seth. Limit or remittance? So both of these use cases. First of all, you can so first of all, you can just start proving things and get people used to the infrastructure. But then when people are used to the infrastructure, They can loop back on the history of these things, and they'll be like, well, We've got a year's worth of proofs here. Every time we have one of these receipts, The payment starts to fly, do you think we can start to automate things? Based on that. And that's the point at which they start to get real process improvements. They can make. They can make business decisions. Such as releasing margin associated with these trades. So there's a massive amount of both, perhaps prepaid collateral. I think that was one of the notes from. Was it xfx?  Me: I think so.  Them: Yeah, maybe check or sue. So there's prepaid funded collateral and stablecoin side. And then there's trapped margin on the traditional FX side, and it runs to hundreds of billions, possibly trillions, globally. It's just gigantic amounts of capital that you can free up if you trust some kind of process. Some. So my claim is that you can have a process that you can trust with common infrastructure that does one thing well. In my case, it's bilateral proofs. So what kind of company is this? Oh, at the moment, it's just me. But I'm just saying is, like, do you view this as, like. It'd be like a. It'd be like a soft. It'd be like a software company. Like, software and licensing. I don't think. I mean, maybe I don't have any imagination and I should let other people do the thinking for me, but at the moment, I just saw it just as a software offering, you know? We. We do a poc with you. So? So you sign up to the service, you get our slice. You get a slice of aws infra that belongs to you, much in the same way like Splunk belongs to you. Or aws belongs to you, so it's your infra. You've got. No one else can get into it. We don't have the keys. We can't get in. You set up, you shut it down. So that gives you the confidence to send your records there? It's sending your own records to your own infra. Right. And they go there. They hit my stuff. I've got this. I've got this fleet of adapters for really a really boring technology, like database adapters, Kafka. Adapters. There could be CSV adapters. If we're talking to real Tier 2 players, goes from them.  Me: Jacket is going to be fifth checker. It'd be like whatsapps.  Them: Fine. Fine. We. Yeah, we. Yeah, we can. We can take it. Signal chats. What's up?  Me: Smoke signals.  Them: Yeah. So it goes from there into my stuff. Signs, everything. Cross signs, everything. It knows what the current time is, which doesn't sound like a big deal, but it's a really big deal. There's, like, secure sources of time. And nist. There's the blockchain. If you like the blockchain, it. It can know what Bitcoin block height or Solana block we're on. You know, cross signs against that so nobody can repute, you know, change their mind or say that it was a different time. And then that's one leg. And then it's a distributed system. It waits for the other thing to happen at the other side, doesn't matter where it is. The other side, again is completely on the run infrastructure. There's no network to set up. There's no consortium to build or any of these. Crazy things that sunk Digital assets, projects. You know, you don't have to be stable. Coins savvy. So you sign your record, the other party signs their record, then you've got this bilateral. Agreement.  Me: Do you want to raise money, But I think Burton says what kind of.  Them: I don't have anything to do with it yet. But. But maybe. So, so far, there's just a Delaware company. Some weapons grade research software that rapidly trying to. Turn into software that somebody could use. So my buddy Big Tony has a use case in the electricity markets.  Me: Yes. Yes.  Them: So. There's a cache settled. Electricity market in the UK, it settles every 15 minutes. So he's got me doing a poc for that. My buddy Eric, who's a special situations guy I mentioned. He's desperate to get me into the supply chain. World like, you know, lithium mining.  Me: Yeah.  Them: All that kind of crap? Because that's. That's a crypto and Iot graveyard. There's all these smoking holes in the ground where the Crypto Bros got in there and totally effed things up. And this stuff is a much lighter footprint, but can do. More or less the same things, but it's got much better privacy properties, so you're not giving away who your suppliers are and all that kind of crap. So these are my two. These are my two leads. So far before I talk to you guys, but, yeah, so far. It's all software, no funding. No people. Just me. I haven't really thought too much about the growth side of things yet. Yeah, well, it's a cool idea. Thanks. The big feedback I have is like, why aren't you spending all your time with payments? Companies like, these are the guys that, like, will get it instantly, too. Yeah, it's true. And I do think. We have more than two portfolio companies that, like, are playing in this. You know, they basically are all set up the same. They have a sponsor bank in the US and they have access to FedNow wires.  Me: Y.  Them: Real time. Ach blah blah. Right? Then they, then they set up stablecoin wallets per country, per entity so that they can do internal treasury in real time, and then sign up liquidity partners in each of those countries so that they can get from their stablecoin Elliot into fiat saying there's a ton of these guys.  Me: Eah.  Them: Yeah, Elliot, you know, it's a good fit. And they all care deeply about accelerating the velocity of these things, right? I bet they do. One thing that really unlocks velocity is unlocking trapped capital. Like payment is like a sign. It's not a small thing for them.  Me: That was basically XFX's, like, core founding kind of story was like, the trapped capital is massive. Like it's sitting there doing nothing. Like we. We should be able to provide faster settlement, basically.  Them: I think it's a decent tech fit and like, so I've got. I've got no idea what kind of. Business I really want to grow. But I do know that this stuff is easy to white label. It's just. It's just raw tech. If you've got these. If you've got these hungry players out there already trying to cut deals with all these people, You know, they can quite easily make it their own because realistically, I've got salesforce of one. I'm not. I'm not going to be out there. Talking to all the people that they are. Yeah, but. But again, you. You said it was distributed, right? So, like, a pair of people have to come together for it to, like, start to add value. Yeah. You have to talk someone else into. Correct. So I think you just focus on where you can get a pair to be able. To start. Oh, sure, yeah, yeah. No, that's the starting point. Yeah, yeah, it actually works standalone as well. You can attest to your own stuff, saying the the velocity goes up exponentially as adoption. No, that's right. There's network effects.  Me: Diameter would probably like this burden, right? Diameter.  Them: Oh, for sure. Well. Again. I don't know enough about their tech stack right now.  Me: Oh, yeah, yeah, because not high velocity, really, is it?  Them: Correct. But. But. But what? What I would. What I would say, Allan, is most of what we've been working on for, like, the past couple years has been, like, various levels of settlement or one level above on the payment side, maybe in inside of some distribution channel that they have on your clients. Yeah. Well, this is where. This stuff wants to sit. Correct. And it's where. It's where existing technologies are doing a bad job. Well, it's not the sexy cocktail conversation, but it's actually the thing that fixes the problem. Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dlts are still out there doing a bad job. Like Digital Asset has this massive new DTCC deal. They're going to create a Elliot garden and some governance nightmare for everyone involved. Well, but did. Did Elliot tell you about our project with JP Morgan? No, you didn't. Well, we have a couple more minutes here, if you have time. But, yeah, one of the. One of the incubation new codes, you know, that we've been, like, working on and having a lot of fun with has been. Morgan basically brought us this issue in their mortgage team that the settlement of the collateral, which is a physical thing. Takes weeks. Right. And so while they're waiting for the docs to be FedExed across the country and scanned in and checked and et Storey has not been released on those mortgages even occurred. Right. But it hasn't settled. So, like, whatever price they agreed on, Right. Like, they can lose or gain lots of money in that, like, time frame that they're, I bet, flying. Yeah. All the money is going somewhere else. It's going to some warehousing. Yeah. There's another great business to be in. Yeah. And so. So basically, they wanted to figure out how do we be able to start to trade the mortgages, the collateral, same day? Yep. Right. And we basically was like, it's not a technology problem. It's like a coordination problem. Like, y'all all need to agree to elect us as the agent, and we sit in between you and the physical custodian. Right. And we will update our ledger. Based on a submission from the seller that is then verified by the buyer. Right. That the collateral has been moved. But we won't actually have move it off the shelf. We're just going to keep it exactly where it is. Okay. Yeah. So that count on what shelf it's on? Yeah, so, yeah, it's the same domain. So everyone involved in this fiasco. Could. Could make a call with their particular record type. To their own infrastructure. And that's the thing. You're not making an external call. You're not. There's no centralized services like just send your records to somewhere in your stack. We've set up just an API call, you know. So it's just like calling a web service. So send up, and presumably everyone else in the network does the same thing. Eventually all meets and gets signed off on a. You know, it's all really, you know, everything's linked. So they've taken care of that. But. But yeah, the. The analysis that we did was for just the JP Morgan trading desk. If were to be able to implement even like t +3, t +4 on the collateral, then it would still be equals 14, whatever it is. It's a T. Plus I don't know is is the answer. Was like a 200 million dollar profit per year. Wow. Because they'll be able to turn their balance sheet one more time. They'll go from three turns to four turns a year. Yeah, so, I mean, yeah, so, like.  Me: So has an experience at jpm. Obviously. I know from, from what I understand from the tech on his, on this side. We'll learn more, I think as we, as we, you know, as he talks to Jeka and you know, diameter and color, we'll figure out exactly kind of what the packaging is. But my understanding, Allan, is that, like, it's basically as long as you just need to confirm something, right? Like it's relatively agnostic in its use case, right? Like, basically.  Them: Yeah, it's totally agnostic. I'm dog fooding it myself. Where I'm making attestations to what I'm up to in aws. So if I ever talk to anyone who's security conscience, Sorry, Security conscious. Then I've got. I've got a string of receipts. I've got a whole tree of proofs of everything I've ever done in aws. And I've also got proofs from a long running process I've got there. That wakes up every 10 minutes. Scans the environment. And then just signs it up to azu, then cross signs it against the current Bitcoin block. So we can see that no one else has been in the aws infra either. The admin account hasn't been used for three months, so my goal is never to use the admin account. And so if I ever do get a security conscious client such as a bank, Or on the industry side. I can point to this. It's got nothing to do with settlement. It's got nothing to do with. Blockchain or anything infrastructure, but it's still doing the same job. It's letting me present people with what's type proofs of things, any old record.  Me: Yeah. All right.  Them: It's a publishing service. Right? Kind of, yeah. It's collating, it's distributed. It's a distributed proof engine. And some adapter technology to make it accessible to other people. And then some presentation layer to give people certificates, whatever they want, database records. Web pages, emails, yfi. I've got another document I could send over. It's like a positioning. This is how I see this tech. It's not especially deep, so you can have a look or pass it around, share whatever you want. Okay.  Me: Yes. And then I think, Allan, what we'll do, as I say, is we'll figure out what to do on xfx. But obviously it seems like there's interest from Jason and connecting there. So, like, you guys should probably just connect. And then with Checker, I'll read through the overview that you shared, and then I'll share that onwards, and I imagine that they'll want to reconnect with you. And then I think me and Burton can just figure out kind of how to sort of, you know, or at least, you know, figure out from our side what we would most like to do as next step. So we can.  Them: Great. Y. Ep. Yep. No, no, that'd be great. I've got no one. I've got no one real, really. On the bright ideas department, I've got. I've got my special situations guy. I've got big tony in the apac region.  Me: I. Love big time.  Them: He's the electricity markets guy. But apart from that, it's just me. Me and Claude, so I definitely value talking to real people.  Me: We have pints of Victoria before, right?  Them: Avoid going insane. What was that, Elliot?  Me: We had pints with Big Tony, right?  Them: That's right. Yeah, we did.  Me: Before in the church. Ill.  Them: Yeah. So. So. So the other, just to put it on there is. There's one company that's raising capital right now, which is Double Sharp, which you should talk to at some point, for sure. Chris is also in New York as well. I don't know if you're still in. In the New York area. Yeah. Jersey Shore, but close enough, yeah. And then this other one which I just put into chat, which is 10 sec. So this is another cross border payments business. They're in the process of signing a contract with xfx, so. And I know the CTO there very well. Both CTOs very well. So this could be a potential actual like. Oh yeah, that's perfect. Two organizations, they're both tech savvy. They both do something, they should start signing with each other. And then automating stuff off the back of that. That's the path. Well, the time thing is real. You know, keeping track of top payments businesses is not. Yeah, no, no, it's definitely real. And also, I've engineered this whole thing for batches as well, because that's another thing that keeps them syncing distributed ledgers. And crypto. Nobody handles batches, so I can. I can clear, like, 25,000 records per second. In my settlement batches. And that's. That's with zero optimization on my side. So they clear. It comes with this beautiful proof that some clearing invariance are satisfied. So, namely value is conserved. You don't want to clear a bunch of settlement records and find that you've lost value so I can prove that value is conserved. And I can do that 25,000 times a second. With, like, no extra help, just on a laptop. Tooling around.  Me: Show off.  Them: Yeah. That's me. I thought you'd like that one, Elliot. That one, Elliot showing you his. His Claude creation.  Me: No, we haven't. Yeah, that's something. I mean, that's very much. I've been. I've been really working on that, but.  Them: Not yet.  Me: I'd be curious. Actually, Allan, I should. I should show you. I'd be curious how dot off. Oh, how shit the code is. But it's very, very clear. Close to code freeze time, so that then I work on the front end a little bit. So, yeah, it's exciting.  Them: Okay? All right? Right. Anytime, Elliot. All ears.  Me: Thanks, buddy. We've got to run.  Them: Okay, well, no. Thanks for the catch up. It's great to reconnect with you, Matt.  Me: Yeah, Allan, you know, I'll manage. Matt's always around, obviously, you know, call him whenever you like or whatever, but, like, you know, I'll manage stuff on our side for funneling stuff through to you.  Them: Okay, great.  Me: All right, buddy, talk soon.
