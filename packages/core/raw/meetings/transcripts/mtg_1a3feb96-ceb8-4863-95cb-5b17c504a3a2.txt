 Them: Like SMB funding and lending. That's our flagship business where we had, you know, the bulk of the revenue. And David snake off is the GM of that business. And then the newer business is the mortgage business. That business was launched. You know, the thesis of the series C was like, look at what we did in S and P. Give us some cash. We'll do the same thing on a bigger scale in mortgage. And this year, we brought in a woman named Nadia Aziz to be the GM of the mortgage business. She was CEO at Roostify, Chief Commercial Officer at Optimal Blue. She was the GM at Open Door. So she's been, like, in the mortgage tech space for a long time, and she came in to. To run that business. Underneath that, we have what's called the opereless platform. The platform is the infrastructure that's the ability to read financial documents, any format or quality, with perfect accuracy, the ability to detect fraud. And it's also where all of our, like, model orchestration lives, where today we have a pretty sophisticated approach for like model evaluation and selection. We primarily apply that to reading financial documents today, but it's the same infrastructure that can underpin like agentic underwriting and more sophisticated use cases in the future. So like net net, the way to think about it is. The business as a whole does about 50 million in ARR. The S&P business does about 30 million of that. That SMB business grew about 40% this year. So it is. You know, it's at scale, but it's still. It's still growing. The mortgage business is the fastest growing business. That is now at about 15 million ARR. And at about doubled in the last year. And that thing is like taking off and where you know so much, so many documents are out there, a lot of tailwinds in the market. Like that's going to be the biggest growth driver for next year. And then the platform. The platform underpins the SMB and mortgage business, but there's also this concept of, hey, if you're not in SMB or mortgage, you can still use the Oculus platform and you can build your own user experience and interface and, you know, integrations, etc, on top of us. So like in S and B and Mortgage, we use the platform, but we build our own specific UX analytics for those use cases. Integrations into systems like Encompass, which is the biggest mortgage system. If you're using the platform, you basically use our building blocks and you build your own solution. For example, Plaid Income. Uses our you know doc processing and then they plaid has their own income solution. So in platform we have use cases in consumer lending rental we have Jackson Hewitt is a big tax prep firm that built on top of us. We have a big deal with bankruptcy software company so that that part of the business does another 7 to 8 million in ARR. Even though it's not really kind of a focus point right now, it's more like people can build their own solutions on top of it. But the other way to think about it is as more and more of those come in, it's also where we learn about what might be the right use case for us to spin up vertical three or vertical four and kind of like replicate the vertical strategy over time. So let me just pause there and see if you guys have any initial questions about the structure? Well, more so. What. What do you. What do you think this year looks like? Like if we're having this conversation next year, what is the mix?  Me: Yeah, I was going to say, what changes? What's the next big thing? What are the focuses now going forward?  Them: Yeah. So I think this year we're looking to get to north of 75 million. ARR. So we we grew close to 50% in 2025, and I think we're going to grow 50% plus in 2026. Most of it is just customers that we've already signed that are now ramping, launching and and growing. Mortgage will be the biggest driver. Mortgage will double again. So we think mortgage can get up to call it like 25, 30 million ARR by the end of the year. SMB will continue to grow like, you know, 30, 40% ish, and then the rest will come from platform. So I think, you know, if you look out. To getting to 100 million like S& B and mortgage are going to hit 50 million ARR at about the same time. SMB is the bigger one today. Mortgage is the faster growing one. But but over time like the the biggest thing we're focused on is mortgage. In mortgage like the average labor cost to process. A loan is $7,500, and the average software cost is 500 bucks. And it's primarily they're paying in Compass, a loan origination system. Our product and mortgage costs about 20 bucks right now, and it's focused on. On income. Ingesting all these documents, understanding a borrower's income. Whether you're a wage earner or you're a non traditional borrower. You have rental properties, your personal trainer on the side, you have shares in a startup. Like you have a more complicated income scenario. We can read all your documentation. Hit Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's APIs and give you back a GSE approved income calculation. And we make about 20 to Bucks per application doing that. But what's, what's most exciting about the 26 and 27 plan is like, now we have underwriters using our mortgage income tool. In a dashboard, and they're. They're doing actions based on it. They're making adjustments to make the income calculation more aggressive to qualify for different loan products, or they're using our response to condition the next step in the mortgage process. Oh, I found this. I have to go back to the borrower. And ask for a new document about this account. So, basically, we're recording all these actions, and we're now starting to build this conditioning suite. Which just takes away the manual labor. So there's. There's a near term world where Instead of charging 20 bucks per application, we could charge 100 bucks per application for the mortgage product. And instead of the mortgage lender paying 7,500 for underwriters and processors or closers, maybe they pay 5,000 and they pay us a little more, and they save a couple thousand bucks in the process and have a shorter end to end. So that's the biggest growth driver we did sign about. Like 85 mortgage customers this year. Like, we had a really strong logo velocity in in mortgage. So that that is what's going to carry the growth primarily in 20.  Me: What changed, sam? How did mortgages turn the corner? Was it just how have we managed to sort of really get that thing going?  Them: Yeah, I think first, like, it's a complicated product, so it took a while to get product market fit and handle all of the, like, doing income scenarios. It's like the only, the only way to do it is, like, to be in the flow of it in real life and, like, to see all of the different at bats and make those adjustments. So it took some time to be able to handle the long tail and get really great. Product market fit, customer references, those types of things. I think that as we got more customer references, like, this year we signed Zillow, and they've been a huge success story with us. And like, you know, traditional mortgage lenders want to look at people like Better Mortgage or Zillow and say, what technologies are these guys using to make their process faster? But then there's even a bigger thing, which is the. The biggest thing by far is just AI Tailwinds.  Me: Nice.  Them: It's like chatgpt came out. Everyone's like, oh, what can this do? People tinkered around and had their CGL try to build a little chatbot or something internally. Not a lot of it made it to production for, for mortgage lenders and very regulated financial institutions doing internal builds. And then there's kind of urgency this year where, like, the board was saying to these guys, like, go put AI on your roadmap. Here's a budget to go buy something AI and it was like a C level directive to go automate. And now we now have 160 mortgage customers and it's about 8080 banks and non banks.  Me: Right. We. Love that.  Them: So like it was almost all non banks to start and now the banks are all like realizing they need this shit, otherwise they're going to go out of business. Where. Where do you see the in mortgage? Because it's like on the expansion opportunity for you guys too. It's like. What portion of the book are you getting? Because I can imagine this is the, like, more complicated income earner use cases. You guys are delivering even more outsized value. Out of a mortgage originator that you're getting. I'm sure it differs a ton by originator, but how do you guys think about how much of their book you get and how much more of their book you can get versus Want to relegate more of? Like, I don't know what to do with this person because they have a bunch of rental payments. Good question. So when we first started, we were getting our foot in the door with non QM only non qualified mortgages, which are typically like bank statement income loans. That was like 5 to 10% of the mortgage lender's business. To get the 90%, we had to build out the QM product. And to your point, the self employed piece was or the, you know, non traditional, self employed, more complicated scenarios, that was the easier one to sell off the bat because it takes forever for them to do it manually. Like if somebody has 20 rental properties, it literally could take you two weeks to go through it. We could do it. In 15 minutes. But what happened this year is we really turned the corner with the GSE integrations. Once we got the GSE integrations live. Everybody wanted to use us for full share of Elliot Because then it was like, hey, like, I now care more about consistency versus only time savings, and I'd rather have one consistent income pool for everything that comes through. So the vast majority of mortgage customers now do use us for 100% of the flow that comes through. So of your 160 customer, like, overwhelming majority of them are using 100% of their origination volume. I would say definitely over 100 are. There are some that use us like what's called classify only, where they only use this for document classification they don't use for income. There's some still stuck on non QM only, but like a majority are now full share of Elliot Yeah, perfect again. Ends up impacting the story a bunch of ways. Like, the more of the entire book you see, the more additional service product area you have to be able to sell. The flip side is obviously like, you've already sold those use cases into the customers for the first hundred, so you can't grow. Off of expansion there, like the remaining 60 is your expansion opportunity. With volume. But I think both are really important parts of the story, so it's helpful. I think the land and expand is huge though, even after we get to full share wild because it. It goes back to this concept of conditioning. Like once you're in with income. Basically, what they want you to do is just automate more of the underwriting process for them. And it's like, especially in mortgage, like, they all do it. Onshore with employees that make $60 an hour or something like that. And like, you know the man, any manual task is so ripe for like, energetic process. That part of our, our part of our VC pitch is like one within the install base, there's at least a 5x growth potential from a pricing power perspective. In mortgage as we move up the chain and take. Take on more of these higher order tasks. But then the second piece, which, which is not as much of a fundraising thing, it's just something that I'm keeping in my back pocket, is like, the mortgage market is still dead. It still operates at like 50 to. 60% of the normalized volume over the last couple decades. So we hopefully will see this moment where we have like a big coiled revenue, you know, spring, where if there's a Fed leadership change and rates come down, like, there could be a world where our existing mortgage customers just do double volume overnight without us doing anything. Makes sense. Hopefully. You go ahead, Matt. The only thing I want to turn to is just, like, board investor dynamics, like, where people's heads are at. Like, you know, where you can get some support on that front, too. I know you have, like, a great group of folks on the table. I'm sure there's always people. Who are trying to figure out. And I've been in those rooms too. And they're not always the most fun rooms to be in, as people are like, waiting for the mortgage industry to come back. And then it comes back like, we knew this all along. Like, okay, the board is hilarious with this stuff and you definitely see some fair weather fans. And now out of the woodwork, I'VE investors emailing me being like, oh, we have a thesis that the mortgage cycle is going to be positive. It's like, oh really? After five years of a dead market, you have a thesis it's going to exist again. Thinking about the Ventures We are going to Ventures this year. The company does not need cash right now. But we do need, like, a refresh to, like, you know, get some people liquidity, get a new late stage investor in that kind of thing.  Me: Where are we? Profitability, Sam.  Them: We're basically there. We burned, like, under 100k in December, January, we'll. We'll finish here in the next three days, but we. We might hit it in January or we'll be very close. We're basically running at break even right now, and we're making, like, selective hires, like. As. As we, you know, revenue ramps. Each month we're making a couple hires, but we're, like, basically not losing any cash. We're. We're in a good place with that. So we're thinking about running a process like mid year. The thought right now and I'd love your guys feedback on this but the thought Is raise like 150 ish plus or minus about half and half primary and secondary. The primary is four. We have a few specific like growth initiatives and bets that we want to make the secondary would be primarily for early investor buyouts and for also to like, run a tender offer and give some more cap table liquidity. Our our existing investors are about like, I'd say, like. It's basically like what you'd expect. The early people want to sell. The mid people would love to sell like 10, 15% and hold the rest. And the Series C people will likely participate. You know, pro rata. Got it. And anyone pushing more in or I know OG just did a bit of liquidity with some other folks. Is that like, where you're seeing some, like, they're in the middle, basically and others are pushing more heavily and less heavily. Got. Yeah. Ok. Is our biggest one and their. Their overall like supportive and want us to keep going. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, on that Ventures like, my advice to you would be to find an M and a transaction as part of it, because tying that story into the primary raise is much easier in today's market than just saying, hey, we need $75 million just to keep building, just because, like, you're at the point where the business is now over a decade old. And like what I see, you know, from Wayfire and others, soon as they got to break even, They've switched an M and A mode. They're now getting probably 30 to 40% of their growth this year will be inorganic. And that is like a story that investors just love because you're plugging in 15, 20 million dollar revenue into an existing business and yes, you were taking integration, risk, etcetera blah, blah. But if that's the plan for middle market, I would try to figure out, like, is there, you know, opportunities for you to gobble up because you survived. You're a top 10% company. Most people did not. And for the companies that did survive and get to break even, but let's just say they're smaller than let's say they're at 15 million in revenue but break even. The issue is the Ventures are fully vested. The VCs are typically tapped out at the board level. They've already done two or three bridges, and there's no ability to raise the next round. Right because of just those internal dynamics. And the team is like gonna all churn this year. At the end of the day. And so, like M and A, even if it's for overpriced ocralist stock, is, like, very attractive.  Me: Uel how Integra is actually executing some M and A as part of that narrative. Do we just need to dangle the carrot for the story and kind of if nothing really happens after the fact, that's fine.  Them: Well, ideally. Ideally, do a small one. So that we can at least, like, point to something that, like, we have succeeded and now you. We're getting permission. But, like, for example, Cap Chase. Right. Cap Chase ended up having to pivot, you know, ended up sort of in a sketchy position, but was able to be bailed out because they bought their biggest competitor.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Bartana. Not because there was anything wrong with Verta's business, because the app table was broken and the Ventures and the VCs were fighting and it looked like it was just going to blow itself up and trip deadlines and etc. So Cap Chase was able to buy a bigger target than they were. And when it's all said and done on the dilution side, I think it's going to be sub 10% dilution for that business. You know, and so these opportunities will not be available, in my opinion. 2027, 2028, like, this is the year. That's the last time where we have, like, you know, we got connected to another company just like this in the trade factoring business called Mundi. Right. $20 million business. But, like, they've pushed their debt providers as much as they possibly can. They've pushed Union Square Ventures and Haymaker as much as they possibly can. And, like, we're just at a point in which, like, they've run out of options, their cash flow break even, but, like, they can't grow from here. You know?  Me: So how Aiden's been doing it is starting Wayfly array. It's been just a very small, self contained, kind of like five person tech aqua hire type situations to start.  Them: If you can then cross sell to the rest of his customer base, you know, he finds somebody who the initial ones that we started with was something that we know that all the customers are going to adopt is currently on the roadmap. Is fully already built out with a tiny team that never was able to sell. You know? Yeah. And then the nice part is you think about the tying this to the round is twofold. One, like, the question folks are going to have is, like, if I give you more money, can you grow more? Right? Like, and how much more can you grow? And candidly, it's like macro is a big part of SMB. Lending and mortgage. It just is. So you're like, maybe, maybe not. But we're not, like, fully in control of our own destiny. I think people generally see that, especially with, like a large secondary tied to large primary. The question is going to be like, what am I investing in? Am I investing in a growth am I investing in the return? The second piece is. Then everyone loves the AI thesis right now of there's a lot of inefficiency and companies that have good tech stacks. Should benefit from that efficiency. And so if you can start buying some of these things, That they monetize at X dollars. You monetize it Y dollars. Because your operating process is better or. A Matt's point, like they've sold the 10 customers. You know, there's 15 customers in your existing customer base. You can cross L2. That pays for the deal twice over those types of acquisitions. Not only do they love the accretion investment thesis, but they can see how they can start deploying 20, 30, 40, $50 million into the round in the future, which might. I think the concern would be like, there's a lot of people, like, maybe I'll write this check now, but your break even. Like, you can't really spend more to grow more. So how am I going to get enough dollars at work that I care about this thing? In three to five years, the answer is, like, we might deploy 150 million bucks in M and A. Right now, we're deploying $40 million in M& A. But you want to give first luggage M and A. Like in a super efficient, really good compounding, durable, growth way. Because we are established, we are stable, we're not going away tomorrow. We're the way to do it. So I totally agree with what we're Matt's heads at is like, it opens up more Ventures dollars. It helps you grow and control growth more. And just makes the whole population and story more of an offensive play than a defensive investment. I think you're on mute there, Matt. Sorry. I think he's echoing that. But yeah, it's optionality, right? All of a sudden, like the mortgage market can pick up and drive. The macro could win. Or we could keep on executing an M and a strategy and win. Right? Like. Or like our goal is. To have, like, three or four different paths to go at the end of the day, right? Like, the issue that you're going to have is, is that, like, for how long the company has been around, your revenue is still not that high. So that is the biggest first thing that everyone is going to say, because it's always momentum divided by time. At the end of the day, right? And so you need to break out of that and say, I'm not a fifty million dollar business. You need to look at me as somebody who's like, I can be $150 million business, like, in the next year, 18 months and then that. That's the mental rain, which was another one of my QED portfolio companies. Exact same position as you. They.  Me: Not the credit card. Rain.  Them: Not the credit card, the ewa. I don't know if you ever met Alex Bradford. They're similar to Daily Pay and, and these type of guys, right? There's nothing wrong with this business, right? It's growing at 30, 40% per year. Very predictable cash flow positive. The only issue is they're at 50 million in revenue. And so, like a vast majority of investors have just said, we don't give a. Like you're just too small. I think I'm hearing on the M and A side, obviously, there's this, like aspect of it's much clearer where you're going to deploy the funds. There's this future component of, like, hey, if we do a small one and we're successful, like, there's a war chest and we can now, like, rinse and repeat. What about just on, like a multiples basis? Like, do you think that also affects the way that they would look at a revenue multiple, or is it more just like use of funds and ability to bring certain investors to the table? Well, sometimes it will increase your multiple. Depending on the type of business you're buying. Yeah, you can arbitrage that. The biggest thing we I've seen on some of the MA here is twofold. One. Your multiples. Like, investors are probably going to trade your multiple in some reasonable smaller band than the market. The market has multiples like this range because you've been around longer, because your growth rate somewhat variant. And like people are going to underwrite some growth rate that they're comfortable with. And as a result you're going to get your multiple and it's going to be like on the mid to low end of multiples in the market, because momentum divide by time. Their mentality is like, they've got the new momentum and it's going to pick up. But like, here's what I can really underwrite. So there might be one or two investors that are up here. But in general, if you're talking about a larger raise, you're going to get normal, multiple ranges. One is like, what does M and A do? Two things. One, multiple times, you know, revenue, it's going to give you more revenue. So you get higher valuation at the same multiple level and then two, it gives them a reason to believe they get underwrite a higher growth rate overall. Which will hire multiple. And so this is very much like the story that's working well for, like, a company line called Kayana, who's, like, growing pretty well, like, kind of like 50% year on year. They add some M and A in. Now they're growing at 75% year on year. Well, now they deserve a higher multiple and they have more revenue compounding. And so I think worst case scenario, it doesn't hurt you on multiple. It helps you on revenue, which helps you on valuation. As long as you're buying things that aren't, like, extremely expensive for no revenue opportunity but you won't like. We can all talk about how to avoid, like, those types of M and A transactions. And two, it gives a durable argument, especially like, here's one, here's the next 10 that we haven't done yet, but here's a list of things we like to go do. It gives a durable path on how you can compound at 50% year on year for the next five years, regardless of macro cycle. Whereas right now, if I'm skeptical investor, I might be like, well, during bad cycles, you're growing a lot lower during great cycles, around 50. So let's call 30% the actual normalized growth rate that I can feel comfortable you control. That's what I'll do for you. What about the size of the raise? We got some feedback on this in the board meeting and there were some, some mixed feelings about it. Like what's your guys advice? Like just like straight shooting, like the number. You should, you should not have an opinion on this. So let me push it back to you. Let me tell you the facts and you tell me how you would position. The facts are we could benefit from having at least 75 million in liquidity for, you know, for shareholders. From a primary perspective, we really don't need that much money. Like, I think 50 million would be great to, like, do growth investments and have, you know, cash for a rainy day. 75 is a little bit more of a stretch of, like, growth bets we'd have to make to get there. So that's what we, like really need. How would you position to the market? Or how would you balance sheet? Balance sheet today? Yeah. What's your balance sheet today? Like 15 million. Ish. So again, right. We don't have an opinion on the size of raise. That's not your job as a CEO. Our job is to find strategic investors who can add value, who can grow the business. They tell us what their check size are, and then we figure out what the midpoint is between where the secondary wants to sell, where, you know, like, it could be a 30 million dollar raise, it could be $150 million range, but like, I don't think you're going to be able to know. Yeah. And. And you don't want to highlight it if you can avoid it to Matt's point, because there's no benefit to highlighting. I think internally the answer is, look, guys. What we would like and need. Enough. Enough that investors want to come in. If the answers were raising 10, a bunch of investors are participating. So you need enough like, look, I think for a primary standpoint, we probably could use, you know, $30 million, $40 million of bolster the balance sheet, go after some of the 7A, invest in a couple things like that's the baseline such that we should talk to all these funds that have $25 million minimum check sizes. Great. Beyond that. It's like we have, if there's a lot of interest, we have the ability to scale up. And people know that they can scale up, but there's no reason to tell the range because you're going to end up being under or over definition. Let's role play it with me for one second. I'm the investor. How much are you guys looking to raise?  Me: We're getting pulled around in all kinds of directions at the moment, to be honest.  Them: We're considering lots of different options. We have some people who want us to raise a big round. We have some people who are wanting to raise a lower route. We want some people who want discounts on secondary. Like, at the moment, we're just trying to figure out who's interested in the company.  Me: I've got advisors telling me to do M and A. How have you guys seen success with this sort of stage company? Why don't you talk and then shut up and then they'll talk to you. And typically, what they'll say is directly correlated to their incentive.  Them: Cor. Rect. Yeah.  Me: And the only way you will retain leverage is to signal optionality in order for you to then have them sing to you back, right? And then all you're doing is gathering the info. You're Switzerland. You're the only one that knows all of this stuff, and the only one that can balance all of this stuff, so you have no idea. You're just asking pokes. And you will put together what you think is the best outcome that may or may not arise out of that.  Them: Yeah, and it will be laughable how like obvious there advice lines up with their incentives. Like the guys who only can write 50 million dollar checks will tell you you should at least raise 50 million dollars. The guys who like, struggle and are difficult like, no, you should keep the round side smaller and more nimble and like. This, right? Like, but again, you don't care. You're just. You're just asking for advice on the market, and then you get the chance to build a supporting relationship with every single investor, to feel like you were there advocating for them. And this is the big piece you go into, which is like, yeah, we're doing comment like a small tender for the team. We've done it before. We're doing a small tender for the team. Like, we don't need much capital for the tender. We just don't have enough shares that we're going to let people sell to have it work. And there should be one right? Big check. So I'm like, look, my advice to you, I've known you a long time, insert fund. We only went to a small group of people. Don't, like, ask for exactly what you actually want. And trust that you and I will have a conversation, and I will try my best to figure out how to make it work. Don't ask for too little because you think it's going to push around. Don't ask for too much because you think you cut back. Ask for actually what you want. And I will do my best to try to work with you to figure out how to make that happen. And, like, we've known each other long enough that, you know, I'm going to, like, work in good tent to do that. And then everyone gives you their number and then you have all of the information and. Then you're like, okay. This person wants to write a small check, they'll be desperate to do it because we have enough people that'll fill the whole. And now you build the weave. And so I think it lets you do two things, Sam. One, like you just don't know how much capital you don't want to over. Promise to existing investors. You don't have any of that. 2 you will then get at the end of the story. Be the helpful one who is like, look, I actually wasn't trusting on make his work for you, but I really liked our conversation. Here's how I can make it work for you. Can you meet me in that spot to make it work? Yeah. I know that you're price sensitive, so I figured out that if we put 30% of secondary shares and 70% of primary shares, the blended amount, like, gets you to your ownership target. And then all of a sudden, like, you're doing them a favor, designed around for them based on all the inputs you had, which was the only way to design around anyway. And so it, like, ends up being a nice gift that doesn't cost you anything. Yeah, good feedback, Jason.  Me: But it's critical that you're undecided. Say you have to position yourself as being constantly kind of just. I don't know, I've got three or four really viable paths and I'm just really kicking the tires on it. That has to be the undercurrent of the whole. Kind of positioning.  Them: We might sell the business. We've been in talks with people on the M and A side. We might, you know, ramp up our M and A and start buying. Like you just are always projecting optionality. Makes sense. Jason, what do you typically see on, like, the tender offer or secondary? Like, what's the. The discount or the structure compared to the new stuff, totally dependent on the company. At our scale, there's no delta. Like, I literally tell investors, like, if you are worried about the prep stack, Do not come in. Talk to me about being an investor. Like, we've raised, I don't know, 600 million of prep against probably $8 billion company. Like, it's like, if you are worried about the prep stack, then you are not a believer in this business and you should absolutely go somewhere else and then everyone's like, no, no, no, no, it's not perhaps, issue. And you're like, yeah. I'd say most commonly, like for big AI companies, you're seeing some gap in separation. If they're not like N of 1, the 1, everyone. Because they're raising four billion dollars on a seven billion dollar valuation. Like, I might get totally rip. I might get wiped either way, but I might get wiped really badly there. And so I think. How much prep have you guys raised today? Like 110. Yeah, like at your revenue scale and stuff. Like. I think you also have a somewhat credible story here, though, because M and A is a more probabilistic outcome for you. Than for a company that's, you know, 10 billion dollar company or an 8 billion dollar company, just because there are more buyers in the universe as a benefit like. It will be slightly more on folks minds than otherwise. And so again, you don't have an opinion. You're like, I'm just going to let people tell me. It's like there's a lot of interest in second there's a lot of interest in primary. Like you will end up figuring out the discount you want to offer to match this in the end based on these guys really want a lower price. You don't want to give them a lower price. You want a better headline price so you can have dilution management to your employees. Great. I'll let you buy some secondary on here. I'LL set the prep price here and issue equity to my team based on this price. You have lots of tools in the tool belt, and right now Candy just feels like probably too many tools. What you want to do is go one get the largest universe of folks that you can that are relevant. To come in. Get excited about the inflection point. Leave enough flexibility in how you're raising the round. And making each feel like they have a pathway. To you. Being them made the perfect fit for you, that they all come in to have a conversation, and once you see how much capital they want to pour in, then you go back to investors and you start saying, a bunch more leverage. Like one thing we've looked at. And totally want to work with you on this is are there people who actually want to, like, get out, who are like, non believers early? Right. You never know. You never, like, socialize this to your investor base of like, I have a lot of capacity. People who want to get the hell out. That's not a good narrative. But you might. You might have them willing to get out in a really cheap price, because I'll take any liquidity. In which case, like, you should work with not you guys. Like, we could say, like, do you work with a second, like a third party? Closer to, like, go buy the bottom of the book dirt cheap. And then exchange actually anti dilute while you're raising capital. So like, if you know you can raise it 200 bucks a share and these guys are willing to get 100 bucks a share. Go quietly. Buy it up at 100. With someone else's capital, allow them to come in at the 200 round and then be like, but you're going to burn off like 40% of the shares that you bought down here so that you're actually paying 180 average. I anti diluted and I bought the bond. You're saying you get those people early so that if you do a secondary and a tender, then, like the people you care about, you can actually deliver to them at a higher price. It's another value chip you get to give them, which is like, I can lower the price of my pref round. Don't want to do that. I can lower how much I'm raising. Don't want to do that. Or I can let you buy this stuff that I don't actually care about, but there's a big gap in delta value. And I can give you some of this value in exchange for you giving me something I want. For example, QED is in, like, dog shit position right now. Like they need liquidity across all of their funds right now. Like, they're willing to take large discounts if they can get real liquidity. And you know this. We can go through your list of early investors, and, like, I can tell you, are they in a position of strength or are they in the position of weakness? Right. You know, and. And what Jason's saying is, like, think about if the fundraisers in the summer, you might have some cleanup stuff that. You want to do ahead of the Ventures you might want to swap out board members. You might want to add an independent. Like, there's a lot of stuff that, like, needs to be done ahead of the raise to make sure that you're going to be the most successful or have the most flexibility. Especially when you know where the raise is likely to land. Then you basically get to fully arbitrage. And so, like, you want to have these conversations, get to know folks early enough that you're like, I can buy at 100 and sell at 200. Like, amazing. Again, I would not recommend you company capital, Sam, do this. Because you don't want to go and be like. And a month later, you raised a 200. Like, what the. Sam. Like, you knew this. And by the way, you try to buy it, everyone's going to be like, what do you know that I don't? But you do want to, like, view this as I have a bunch of money that I'm able to create for someone. I want something back for doing that. Who do I trust to go run that playbook so that they can come on cap table and accrete value back to the business? Correct. Like, brokers are doing this all the time. It's just insane to me that companies aren't benefiting from brokers doing this. And so it's like, just be your own broker. By finding a broker that will give you value. Do it directly instead of making people go, you know, to the corners. I go out and I buy a bunch of this stuff because I fucking love awkwardly. And then, like, I found a way to share value back with you. Like, totally different. Then you'd be like, look, we know Jason. I'm willing to let him buy it. Otherwise, we're going to force transfer restrictions like you. Have all this leverage to go and create that value. Yeah, because you can block all of this stuff. Exactly. It's like, you can get out with Jason or you can knock it out. It's totally up to you. But we know and, like, Jason, if you sell to anyone else, I don't know, and, like. Them. They're not coming in or whoever the person that could be any of your existing relationships. And then you're. You have like a handshake agreement with them that they're going to go clean this stuff off and then they're going to lead the next round or participate with a meaningful check or. You know, however this thing works, lots of tools. It's good advice. I like it.  Me: Well, Sam, if you want to. If you want to sign a contract, buddy, we can do this every week.  Them: There you go. Good pitch. Show value first. I love it.  Me: Well, look, I think we're at time, and I want to be conscious of everyone's calendars. Great to catch up, buddy.  Them: Great seeing you guys. I really appreciate the advice and definitely if if anyone's in the city, shoot me a note. Would love to catch up and Jason would love to catch up on some Oculus plaid stuff. I know we missed each other like ships during my 2020. I'm going to be back in New York probably next month or so, and so I'd love to catch up and then. Let's spend some time lays it down and chat some more about all of this stuff. And congrats on the acceleration. Are you sending out monthly notes to like, not non investors right now to warm them? Not invest? I mean not, not really. Like the big, the big thing we do every year is we write an annual report, which our fiscal year ends on the 31st, so in early February we'll have an annual report and we can start teasing that to like, you know, some series D funds and things like that. And obviously, I'll send you guys a copy. Yeah, yeah. In general, like, start to over communicate now. Like, a full six months. These guys, like, are the later stage they are, the slower they're moving. So you need to remind them that you exist as soon.  Me: We can get into all the tactics about that Sam, but typically six months out you got your six monthly updates. You probably want to do them on a bi weekly cadence as you get nearer to your first term sheet. You want the thread of that six to nine emails to be directly in tune with when your KPI pops at its hottest point, that whatever that metric is that you're anchoring around for your round, we kind of want to manufacture it a little bit such that that is popping when we're talking about Oculus, the loudest vis a vis driving towards the first term sheet. So there is a little bit of a tactical stuff there, and we'll put tracking in place so you can see the open rates, all that kind of stuff.  Them: And then existing investors, right? Like, for January, we actually want to, like, not increase their excitement. We want to decrease it slightly and have them be very rational and then slowly increase their excitement over time. So, like, we want them to go through the emotional roller coaster as well. Right? We don't want them to, like, we want them, when they get that phone call to be like, yeah, I didn't really know about them at the beginning of the year, but they are. Like, the last three months has been amazing. Like, that's what we want our existing investors to say, because then they're going to project that three month of growth rate for the next two years, and then that's going to give us the valuation, the leverage, like all of that stuff together. And then quicker capital, raise the capital process a little bit, a little structuring, how to do secondary and some of those pieces, the M and A. The last one I'll add that we should spend a little time on and we can chat is I spent way too much time in D.C. in the last six to 12 months for a bunch of reasons you could imagine. There's a lot happening in the mortgage side. Yeah, the 50 year stuff, that's all bullshit. Not going to happen. They are looking at actually making mortgages assumable, which again, as you think about writing this narrative, like, what's to come? And we start preparing, like, yeah, macro is getting better interest rates. Should be coming down. On top of that, there's some structural once in a lifetime changes. This administration is actually looking to do that. If you're ready and you have like the right income verification and tooling around this and how to adjust it, like uniquely positioned to take advantage of this one time giant pie that's going to get opened up. Putting that in the narrative of being important. So, again, these are like the three or four areas. That's an amazing. Why now? Right by now. Look at the wall street journal. What was written this morning. Right? Like, we are the one that are going to take advantage of this and we're close and we're in D.C. and we have connectivity because everyone knows a bit of a pay to play ecosystem in that world right now. And so, like you, being part of that community will read a lot more excitement and trust. Like, those are the kinds of things. There's like, an event in March I should get you down to, which is like the Hill and Valley Forum, where like, they just all the DC and the Silicon Valley together. Like, you should come down and then you should lead me to the race talk. Like, I was just down in. DC meeting with X, Y and Z. Yeah. Anyway. And then the last thing, too. Sam, I'll try to grab coffee with you on that. But we've made a lot of progress with JP Morgan Chase on the mortgage side around the new a Newco for them. Cool. And it's we're now at the point where that company is going to be Incorporated and, like, funded. And I actually met the CEO of Chase Mortgage a couple weeks ago in New York. And so anyway, they want to, like, make us the, like, presenter at this important luncheon during the US Open where, like, everyone flies in. And Jamie Dimon. So, again, it's I think we're going to have just a lot more exposure to the big mortgage guys, you know, at Wholesale Mortgage, Prudential, you know, JP Morgan Chase, like, you know, Penny Mac. These are all the guys who have signed up as, like, early partners to fund the thing. That's awesome. I'd love to follow up with you on that and just want to thank all of you for the advice. It was very valuable here in all the insights, and it's extremely timely. I'm taking notes and I'm getting ready, and I'll keep you guys posted as we get closer. Here, Sam. Thanks, guys. Great seeing you.
