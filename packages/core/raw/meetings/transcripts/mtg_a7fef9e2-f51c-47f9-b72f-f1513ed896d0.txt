 Them: It was really just Christmas and the actual first of first of Jen. But we've been quite busy because people still need to move money around.  Me: Hey, everybody.  Them: Hey, Elliot.  Me: Hey, man. Happy new year.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Nice to see you. What's new? Where were you for Christmas in New Year? What did you get up to?  Them: I'm in new york. Yeah. Been in new york.  Me: What did you do? For on the day itself, it must be hard when you're away from family.  Them: Yeah. I mean, look, I'm chinese, right?  Me: No. Are you? I had never noticed.  Them: So it's chill. It's chill. It's really just Chinese and fed. That's more of a thing for Chinese.  Me: Yeah, okay.  Them: But there's no holiday for us because I'm in Europe.  Me: Yeah. Fair enough. And then what did you do for New Year? Anything. Or again. Is that not because you guys have the Chinese New Year, so it's different.  Them: Yeah. I actually forgot what I did today. I think I probably went up. I actually went out. Went up? Went out to a friend's house party or something. Something along those lines.  Me: That good. And then you guys were just, you know, you were just talking. Business is picking up now after the sort of slump from the holidays.  Them: Yeah, Business as usual. I think we had. We had a flat November to December. December was getting quiet. The whole month. So now it was just getting back to it, the blocking and tackling of different accounts and sales and all that. And fixing a bunch of fixing a bunch of shit before we announced the fundraise. So there's a whole. Workflow that I'm working on. Are you going to do a new site before you announce? Yeah.  Me: That's code for please do a new website.  Them: Well, my advice to everyone is do a new website after you raise money. It's just a good hygiene. I literally had the same conversation with Santee on Friday. He wants it quite extensive new website. And I just told him that you're going to have to balance that for how soon you want to announce, right? Because he was like, I want something like the Talos website. And I was like, There's like, 35 pages inside of they. Did they raise a new round? Yeah. We helped manufacture a preempted term sheet from Infinity Ventures, and then the insiders decided that they would rather just take the whole thing themselves. Jeremy losing deal again. I know. I actually felt really bad for the guy, and I called him to sort of apologize because he sort of made a comment.  Me: He really lent in, didn't he?  Them: Yeah. I mean, he. But I told him that this might happen, so he knew that it was in the possibility, and he didn't do that much diligence. It was sort of only like, you know, whatever, seven, eight days worth of diligence. And he appreciated that. He was the only one who got access to the data room, so all that stuff was positive. But on the flip side, he's like, I felt like a stalking horse. And I was like, well, yeah, because you were.  Me: Yeah. Hey, guys, give me one second. I'm just getting a food delivery. I'll be two minutes.  Them: So. Yeah, I'll make these around. So the round ended up being around 18 mil. There's some stragglers, so it might be a little bit higher than that afterwards, but, yeah, it was. It was actually Castle Island. They really, like, stepped up. Is it 100 mo post? Yeah, 100 mill post. That's where I'm sort of seeing everybody in terms of Series A. Is right around that hundred mil. 10 sec did a similar round in December as well, so. But yeah, it's like you try to either be growing like insanely fast month over month, or you try to get to that 2, $3 million in in revenue. And then. Yeah, and then go try to take down, you know, 20 bucks. Yeah. Is that is XFX says 23 run rate. No, they're in the lab. They're in the. Sorry. The former. They just had some. Some really, really high growth rates. You know, they're probably only like 1 and A. Half 1.6 or something like that? Yeah. What's. What's an insane growth rate? Like, double month over month? Yeah. Cool. Yeah, they had a couple. Couple? Really? Yeah, they. Because they launched in September. They did 100 million TPV in the first month and then like 160 and then like 220 and then 300 in November, and that's when it priced. And then December was actually back down to like 2:40. It's the same for us. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I told him. I was like, look, now we reset expectations low. Now we tell them all about the problems we're having. Yeah. You know, and try to guide towards more conservative, you know, and then hopefully we beat plan, you know, obviously. Well, we're at 25. We're 25 mil post. So seems like there is a long way for us to go. I don't know about that. I think you'll do it this summer. If I had to. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. Look, I. I think part of. Part of what I wanted to get a sense of is continue executing a strategy we discussed before, which it just keeps sucking money out of the ecosystem. And so we're just opportunistically take money. And obviously now in January, I don't, I don't think we're in a good spot yet because our sales is not. You know, it takes time for us to fix sales motions and build systems and stuff. But I think thinking about. Yeah, maybe March, April. If we. If we execute well, we should. We should be able to see some nice hockey. Nice hockey stick growth again.  Me: Hey, guys, I'm back.  Them: So can we talk about that briefly? Like, is that because we need to hire salespeople or just because we need to redo the process or redo our, you know, icp? What's the driver there? Drive us. We're taking money or the driver for fixing things. Driving for fixing things. Yeah. Like, are you solving the, the problems with people or processes or both? Yeah. So let me give you a layer of the land of my diagnosis of where we are as a company. So there's a lot of blocking and tech playing, founder led sales, zero to one lack of processes. And now I think we've refined an ICP and our product as it stands, it's on shaky ground to be completing honest. There is a high risk of disintermediation the conversion rate from, from, from sales discovery to closing and then to usage. Because we're usually space pricing, right? So we also need to increase our client's usage. As it stands, is weak. But thinking exponentially, because we have now we have two more engineers who, who joined, who started last week, and then we have one more in Feb. And so as. As we grow a product roadmap. Our service area with our clients grow. And, you know, I'm, I'm confident that conversion rate is going to go up, usage is going to go up. That's not an issue. But then the issue is growth funnel, right? So thinking through top of funnel to conversion to then to then signing. From a payment point of view. Payments to Stablecoin is an icp. It's me and Mike, and we're getting overwhelmed. So, like, we were, you know, our response to clients is slower, working through processes. It's like, it's like slower. We just, we can, we can feel it. And so we put up JD's. And I haven't been able to focus 100% on that because I've also been just doing blocking, tackling myself on accounts. But I put up JD for two sales role. One is Latam, the other one is Africa. Sales to sales to FIs. We did some initial conversations with some some good candidates. So on on those two roles we're in the face of getting a layer of the land and filling up the talent funnel. So that's hiring for sales and then some attend simultaneously. We have a wish list that I'm sending out investor updates and also using my using our new investors to get intros. And those wishlists will be the basically the quota. Quarterly goals. So, like chasing pick logos, for example. That's one North Star, apart from the usual pipeline that we have right now. Ok. Big logos. Do you mean like large customers? Yeah, Correct. So not. Not acv, but just well known. So the goal is, like, so that they sound good in a narrative. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah, I think that makes sense, because a lot of the customers you have, no one has ever heard of them. Because it's. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yeah, they have. They might have good usage and pay us good fees, but, you know, we need, we need to balance that out with legitimacy and stand up approval as well. And then simultaneous, simultaneously. I think the next two months will need to do. We'll need to revamp our sales collateral so things. Like making a playbooks and playbooks with different ICPs taught ICT targeted marketing. And then we're also sponsoring some events. So, for example, in Africa, we're going to sponsor a bunch of stablecoin. Adjacent events, and then we're looking to do the same in Latin. And then my Q2, Q3 will be. We'll be repeating the same thing in an epack. Where? Regional. Regional. Expansion wise, it's currently pulled by demand.  Me: And what does hiring look like for the rest of the year, Jack?  Them: Look, I think I can speak to Q1 and Q2 at this, at this stage. So to sales. So one batm, one Africa, basically effectively GM role. So ideally someone jack of all trades who can do sales, who can do account management, but also able to be a part of the product feedback loop. Basically be our representative on the ground. You know, obviously, I work hand to hand with that person. And then on the engineering side, we're, we're good on the core engineering side of things. We're looking for specifically cross border payments, expertise, engineering, so folks that maybe they come from Wise or Visa Direct or Airwall X and things like that.  Me: Why is. Why do they need that vertical knowledge? Well, what is it there that you don't have currently?  Them: Yeah, so. What? What our team is good at. In terms of sector expertise, I think we've covered. The actually flipping around. We've covered the functional expertise of what our sales Personas were doing. So our Personas, our user Personas are head of treasury, cfo, col types have trading. We cover that? Now as you grow a service area into things like cross border payments, virtual accounts, etc. It requires the different types of expertise. That. Let me give you a specific example. Our current customers. What's top of mind for them and what we're doing for them is we talk about OTC trading, stablecoin liquidity. Same thing as I suppose there are XFX would talk with with a client. But the moment you go into payments and imagine Bitso business, right? Imagine on the. On the banking and payments team, then they talk about opening up virtual accounts whose name is on the virtual account. What is the onboarding requirement? Do you need to onboard the fi client or do you need to onboard the and client? What is the pricing structure? If there's a usage based pricing flat fee.  Me: I just feel like.  Them: On the engineering side.  Me: A lot of that stuff is product owned rather than. Engineering specific. I guess just where I was getting to in that is that I query when you ask for people from those sorts of logos or with that sort of background. I think that you might just end up having to maybe slightly overpay or compete for sort of frothy logos. Whereas it sounds as if that the guidance that needs to be given there is on a product management level first, right? And then the engineering goes and executes rather than you needing thought leaders on the engineering side.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. That's another scenario, correct? Yeah. So if we. If we have. If we. If we have someone, it can be an advisory capacity. Someone who's built this, something similar internally at a firm. I would imagine this will be someone who sits, for example. Let me. Let me give an example. Stripe has a team. I think it's called Global Treasury Payments Network Team. They. They basically do this. They basically do what Checker would do in the payments product. Internally. But in a fiat setting. So someone like that is it can also solve what we have, so.  Me: Yeah, exactly. I would just be wary of putting product design decisions or projecting product design decisions into an engineer's hands or onto an engineer's plate because.  Them: Yeah, same. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Same.  Me: Continue. Continue. Thank you.  Them: So. Yeah, so look, it's too hiring, right? So a payments dev, slash a payments, product advisor, whatever. Call it like either one kills the bird. The second stream for hiring Is sales to FIs. So, for example. I had a good catch up with Elliot and Aldo at Tensec last week that they want to move ahead. Great. So one of our like one of the ideal sales candidate that I want to hire is someone who can also now sell me 10 sex 5 biggest competitors in each countries. And own the process. Get them done. And okay, now, going to. No offense, but let's say that close feet are. And who are the biggest competitors? Of cedar. Go. Close them. Get them done. So that's. That's what I want the candidates, what I want to sales candidates to do.  Me: Okay? That makes sense. We can definitely be helpful there. What else? What other major priorities? Maybe I stepped away. You guys talked about it. But when are we outraising again? Rest assured, we don't have any interest in going out raising it anytime soon. Let's just relax for a second after the last dramas. But when do we think we need to be raising again?  Them: As soon as possible, I think. I mean, look, I'm curious your, your chem check of the market, but we would, I think the situation that XFX is in is pretty desirable for us. I think that's, that's a goal that we can work towards. I think right now, the numbers. The traction is not on Checker side. So we need to fix this. And apart from that marketing, branding, which I'm working with, Galaxy Platform teams Effects as well, they have a pretty good platform team, to be, to be honest. Look, I think. I think we should raise as soon as possible. I had before. Before the drama, we were going through a process with PayPal and Coinbase and. And I think a couple others. Those are the ones that are sort of down definition, further down the process. And obviously, you know, maybe Jeremy from Infinity, if, if there's a fit, if there's a way to tip his hand. Let's say in three or six months, but, yeah, as soon as possible.  Me: Okay?  Them: Yeah. When, Elliot, I would say that we. We were chatting about, like, you know, I think for the next three months, it's like Jack wants to fix the sales motion and some of the product stuff. And, like, there was a bunch of parts of the business that were being held together with duct tape. And so it's like, hardening that up a little bit. But, yeah, I mean, I think, Jack, as soon as you have four months of good data, I don't think you should wait. You know, I think.  Me: No, I mean the market. The market is open, so the only other thing that can be Jack is shut. So let's not do that, right? Let's not wait for it to close. Like right now is a good time. Marrying that against the duct taping that you need to do. And then as soon as you're happy.  Them: Yeah.  Me: I think would be. Do we need to wait for the strategics? Like the PayPal, the Coinbase? Can't they just come in now?  Them: Well, they. They don't like the price, though.  Me: No, but couldn't they just on the last thing?  Them: Yeah. Well, no, but remember, we got. We. We have to take a lot of dilution.  Me: Fair enough. Fair enough. We don't need them for the next. You know. There's no value in having them three months sooner, right? I suppose.  Them: And on those strategics I'm seeing, like, Coinbase used to be, like, 100k check. Or maybe 200k was what they asked for. They just requested a 2.5 million dollar check in the 10 sec round. So, like, they're ramping up for sure. The other data point Jack, for you is Norwest. I don't know if you know that fund is the one that did rain. They did the rain seed round. Yeah. So Jeff Crow, who's, like, the. The founding managing partner there, he was on the board of admelt, the company that Elliot and I were at, and we sold to Google. And so I caught back up with him last week. And basically, because of the rain success, like, they're now putting a lot of resources. You know, into stable coins, you know, and all related investments around it. Sounded like a pretty big shift. So this guy Jordan is the guy who runs it and led that round in rain. I also found out he was, like, roommates with one of the rain founders or his, like, brother's friend. Like, it was. So it was a personal connection, funny enough, for that seed round and. But anyway, I'm talking to Jordan. Today at 3. And. And when. When Jeff Crow introduced me to Jordan, he responded within, like, 30 seconds of receiving the email. So, again, as Elliot was saying, I think the market's open. So, like, you know, if we could get 20 million bucks before it closes, you know, it will definitely help, you know, make sure that Checker is here. For the long term. Yeah, that's right. So. So, look, I think we're. We're steady on 1 mil. Analyzed revenue run rate and like, I think we've been at that. Since probably November. And then we're flat in December and obviously now we execute. So as much so I can do, I can fix the duct taping side from my side. But look, everything is is experimental. There's no right or wrong. Everything is result driven. Right? If I fix the duct tape and it doesn't work in Feb of March. We got to revisit this. And so Ezna revisit the whole duct tape. Like, have I fixed something wrong? Is it, like. Like what I was doing? Well, Jack, I would recommend you that you think about it as, like, growth levers. Right, that we write down now, or if you have an off site this month, every way that we think we can grow the business, right? And some of them are straightforward, right? Like, we can fix our existing product, like, or we can get higher market share from existing clients. You know, but some of them might be a new product or a new Geo. Or we take more risk on the legal side, or we, you know, get into the flow of funds. Right. Stuff that we're not going to just say yes to immediately. But it's good to write it down because, like, if we're sitting here in March and growth is still flat, it's better to like, have it all written down so that the team's like, okay, yeah, this is the next one we pull. You know, we all agreed to that, right? Like, we're not in the business of, like, not having businesses that grow, you know, like, that's just not. You know, startups just don't work. You know, to grow or die, you know, and so, so that. I mean that there's a bunch of off sites this week and, like, most of the agendas are, like, you know. Categorizing what are the 12 to 15 potential growth, you know, hiring salespeople as a potential growth. Right. Like, you know, so we've already talked about a lot of them, but I would be very, like, specific with the team, you know, and, and sometimes the, the team doesn't like talking about some of those because they view it as, like, a lot of work or risky, etc, and you just have to make sure, like. No, no, we're just writing it down. This is just in case. You know it's not the plan.  Me: You didn't do something. Yeah. Yeah.  Them: It's. It's the thing that will break glass, you know, if needed, you know, so that the team is at least understanding that, like, you are a wartime CEO and we will grow. There's no excuses.  Me: So, Jack, we're running up because Matt and I have to run in three minutes. I shared a contract with you. It's new in many ways. So, you know, I'm perfectly happy for you to tell me that. You know, you need to. We need to have a chat about it because you need to understand. Various components, but can we get that signed by this week? And get to work on this various stuff.  Them: Sure? Yes. And also, by the way, who else is. Who else on your team on your side you think will be relevant? For working with Checker.  Me: I think that we'll figure it out as we go. So the mod. The model. The model now, Jack, is, you know, for you, you'll always have access to us, right? Because you've known us for a while. But going forward, one point person for each, you know, one, one account manager, a partner if you want to, for each CEO. Who then with the CEO is responsible for tapping in the resources on our side as and when is necessary.  Them: Yeah.  Me: So I, you know, you know, the resources on our side, being Justin and being Alex on the latam BD side. I could see Alex being very helpful there in the short term around the hiring for the latam BD stuff. And then Jason as well, who, you know, is continuing to support in the background. So I couldn't tell you today because I don't know exactly.  Them: What's. What's Jason's role right now?  Me: What? Sort of. He works mainly on ideation for new codes, on coaching the CEOs around BD stuff, you know, just. Just. Just like the rest of us.  Them: He's a partner. Got it. Okay.  Me: But. But the point being is, I couldn't give you a great answer to that because, you know, it's sort of up to us to figure out as we go along. But they are all available to you, is the point.  Them: Yeah. Got it. So. So I understand. Elliot, you and Matt, you superpower. Understand? Justin's superpower. Alex's power. Done. So basically, overall, it covers what covers Bun Rey's letter, Regulatory legal, go to market motion and. Sort of strategy in crop dap. Is that what is like how okay.  Me: Jack, we need to have another chat. I mean, I don't know how many times we have to go over this.  Them: Sure.  Me: You know, you. You've now worked with us for over a year. You should know by now. But like, we. We can go over it, but in its most basic form, it's whatever is most important for you.  Them: Sure.  Me: Whatever is your highest priority. So typically that ends up being fundraising, legal, regulatory team hiring, etc etc, but you tell us and we go work on it.  Them: Okay? Cool.  Me: But yeah. Go on.  Them: And Elliot, I remember you told me this before, but you yourself will not be. Will not be as hands on on sales as before, right? Or not hands on, but like, sort of.  Me: Again. Again. Totally up to you, buddy. If you tell me that you want me to do is go and sit with Mike and do pipeline reviews every day, that's what I'll go and do. I think the strategic differences is that now we're no longer writing that stuff down on paper, guessing that that's what you might want us to do, right? It's more like here is the full capability set of stuff that we, you know, we can do. Just deploy us where you need it.  Them: Okay? Got it. Okay? Cool. Sounds good. Appreciate it.  Me: All right.  Them: Awesome talk to you. Bye, Jack. Thank you.  Me: Man. I'll ping you, Jack, and we'll. We can set up some time to go through anything if you need to.  Them: Yes. Thank you.  Me: All right, buddy.
