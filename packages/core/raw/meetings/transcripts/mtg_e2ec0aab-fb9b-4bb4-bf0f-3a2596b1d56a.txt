 Them: Managing processes, right? But that means that for every new agent, you have to have internal people building those data pipelines, integrating them, managing them. It becomes impossible. It becomes impossible to do this at scale in any reasonable or normal way. So that's where Roya comes in. Roya is this data layer. Roya is like the central data layer that enterprises rely on to be able to onboard and manage these full fledged capabilities across their stack. Running enterprise grade AI systems through us. Because the way it works. Is, enterprises have a central compliance stack, and there's like a million different AI compliance and governance startups use those. And you have a federated data structure, different data owners across domains, across data products, et Storey So we're kind of this data fabric in between those things, making it easy to just log into. Roya, you onboard? The agent. They go through our agent procurement portal. And you're live. Right. So it's super easy and allows for the kind of data orchestration. That you need if you want to power anything, like agent Orchestration or actually agents in the organization. That thesis has been playing out quite well. By the end of this month will be roughly at 400k in ARR. We're now going live in the next month and a half as well with Unilever across four different teams there in beauty and wellness, personal care Canada, and even global enterprise architecture. We're now partnering with Publicists, the world's largest media agency, to deploy orchestration platform for both their meta, like their client meta, and also some of their other core capabilities. And we're having pretty exciting enterprise traction. So roughly $10 million in pipeline across enterprises in mid market. A lot of that was driven by me and our advisors and existing investors. But now we're actually getting starting to get client referrals or a client. Mon Chateau is now referring a new brands. This past week alone Unilever referred us to LVMH and EL Catarton. So we've stumbled on a really painful problem for these enterprises, and it's been an exciting time for us in terms of scaling and then the other context that might be helpful for the conversation. Is our finishing up a little like friends and family extension round. So we're raising 12 million post cap safe, 20% discount. We since I spoke to Alex, we got another 200k in the door, so roughly 600k left in capacity for that safe. And once you're finished with that's really all just for enge talent to go live with Unilever and publicist.  Me: Awesome. You've been busy.  Them: I've been busy.  Me: Yeah. Good stuff. You can tell that you've done that pitch a couple of times as well. Help me.  Them: Oh, no. I hope it didn't come off too canned. Oh, no.  Me: No, not in that way. It's better. It's better to be rehearsed in that way than it is to be meandering and unclear, for sure.  Them: Yeah.  Me: I don't want to spend too much time on sort of the technical product details because we could spend a lot of time there. But just a few quick questions. When you're connecting the agent in and building that infrastructure to the agent, how has that been? Is it really variable? Help me understand sort of the integration process. And I know that you like to use sort of plaid as the analogy or an analogy. And so I guess that would be like plaids having to screen scrape. In the banks, right?  Them: Plaid is a good analogy beyond even the connectivity paradigm that they presented in their flexibility. Right. They were forced into flexibility because the banks didn't want them doing this, but the law Elliot it. One of our superpowers is that same thing, that flexibility. So our platform lead, Anton Serial, AI researcher in NLP early transform based model research. Places like soundhound, IBM. So basically, when we're superpowers is the ability to a translate across multiple protocols that come into us and Translate, whether it's MCP A2A or semantic queries. Being able to standardize that into a data schema. Is one of our superpowers, right? So that means that regardless of the fuzzy things that come in, we can know what to route, when to route it. What that also means is that it becomes easier to connect. So unlike this infrastructure quote unquote category, we're not trying to impose digital transformation projects on our customers. We meet them where they're at. The vast majority of enterprises aren't technically sophisticated or even using data leaks. Right. Unilever is just now starting to migrate some things through Data Lake. Us being able to tap into both owned databases, things like SharePoint, things like Snowflake and Databricks. Third party platforms using actually open source MCP connectors like Facebook HubSpot. Salesforce is definitely one of our superpowers. Which means that, okay, when we connect, The enterprises do two things. First tell us what data sources you want powering the agents you're either contracting with or building that you want to run through us. Most of the time, it's things in the go to market marketing ops logistics stack which sit in platforms that are relatively easily for us to connect. And the second thing is, you have to point us to what you use in the compliance stack. So whether it's a solution that's AI enabled, a keycard, or whether it's Vanta and even SharePoint files that have your policies, we need to be able to connect to those in the same way. That plaid meets oauth. Because I need to know, am I even Elliot to send the stat or your way? That's actually relatively quick for us. The Unilever implementation cycle. Is looking like a three week implementation cycle. Which an enterprise world is pretty darn good, I think. So we're pretty robust.  Me: From what you've seen so far on the use case side, the agent use case is more internal as sort of building blocks to build processes internally, or are they like customer facing direct to consumer bots, kind of stone each other's shoulders in a long coat, so to speak.  Them: Both. Yeah, both. I mean, at Mon Chateau, they're going to be onboarding customer success and pricing agents. On top of our rails. Beyond even the go to market ones they're using now. At Unilever. It started with internal bots that we're doing. Creative briefs. But the ones that will be orchestrated on top of us now are in content marketing and performance marketing and supply chain and logistics. So folks are really evolving really rapidly on how they're adopting AI capabilities relatively broadly.  Me: Is the Enterprise. That's the right spot for you, based on some logic that you've determined. Help me understand kind of where the sweet spot is for you at the moment in terms of ICP and how that might change in the future or not.  Them: We found pretty good traction right now. Dealing directly with business leads and enterprises that are consumer facing, because those enterprises are the ones that are further ahead on the adoption curve of AI capabilities. Where that semantic bot or that logistics agent or that customer success agent. Is replacing incremental hiring needs, is replacing outsourced labor, is replacing consultancies, contractors and agencies. They're seeing pretty drastic speed improvements, process improvements, and cost improvements. Now, enterprise is also really good for us because there's a direct sale enterprise as Elliot, like Unilever or Monteau, but there's also partnership style enterprises where by unlocking them, we unlock a bunch more customers. Publicist is an example of that. Publicist is the world's largest media agency. So they see us as a capability they bundle into their clients. To lexis and to meta. So for them. The buyer at those distribution folks. More distribution oriented folks is like a VP of capability or innovation. Because it's not just, hey, you're going to directly use Roya, you're also going to be able to use Royal for your clients to drive pretty cool outcomes for them. That's really where we're seeing a lot of traction. The other benefit of starting with enterprise is that we flip the script kind of on its head on how infrastructure has been sold. Infrastructure, as right now, has traditionally been sold in a dev tooling motion. I'm going to sell this thing or widget or tool to a couple of my friend's startups, raise the rate around and then go heavy on top of funnel marketing and brand and try to get to my first 10 million, 20 million, etc. We didn't do that. Very specifically because our belief is that if we can own the data layer in the ecosystem, then we can a verticalize, if you so choose, but B, we basically become a standard. Any agent or capability who wants to work with these Fortune 50 companies has to use Roya. So actually, in many ways, these enterprises accelerate our go to market. And accelerate to be able to acquire that new customers even having to turn on top of funnel. We're still in stealth, right? Our site has nothing. Nor will it until our Series A. And that's pretty deliberate. And I think that Enterprise Motion and that approach, I'm pretty happy with how that's been developing.  Me: Yeah. Sticky are some of these deals, the big ones that you're mentioning, right, like the unilevers.  Them: The marginal replacement is you having to hire dozens of people in engineering manual data pipelines.  Me: And contractually, though? I mean, is it an actual how are you structuring your deals at the moment in terms of.  Them: We structure it license and usage in the same way. You'd structure like a databricks, let's say. The contract. I don't think. I mean, look, we put in a license because we want to make sure there's, like, a good faith effort, right?  Me: Yes.  Them: And we want to make sure that customer buy in. But Unilever alone this year off usage and platform fee will be like a 2.9 million dollar client.  Me: Yeah. And that a lot of that, a lot of that will be usage driven, right?  Them: I don't think. Exactly. They want to run $30 million of agent spending on our rails.  Me: Yeah.  Them: For them. The alternative for them doing that stickiness, like, yeah, we could contractually be sticky. But I've been an Enterprise cfo. I've been a cfo. Enigma, right? That's not where my stickiness would come from. If a vendor infrastructure vendor tried grabbing by the balls in the contract, I'd be quite upset. Especially now. Like when you can engineer stuff pretty quickly.  Me: Yeah. My line of questioning on that topic specifically is more through the lens of an investor who would have a point of view and discount, you know, a certain revenue number, you know, that kind of stuff. Right. So as more, you know, that's where I was going at it from. But yeah, of course. Yeah. I mean. Yeah. What's written on a piece of paper doesn't really even matter half the time anyway.  Them: Oh, the use of j.r.r. yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, totally. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Me: Okay. And so? And so the friends and family. So, like, you know, when did you, when did you start? When did you, when did you get, you know, when did the, when did you incorporate the business, let's say.  Them: The business was incorporated as like a research and development. Project in 2023. But we only went live in April last year, so we've been live with for less than a year.  Me: So, like, yeah, eight months or so. So the momentum is super strong. I mean, help me understand why.  Them: Yeah.  Me: So you're doing the friends and family?  Them: Yeah.  Me: You know, what. What's the thought process around the ordering of stuff that you're. You're doing and kind of why you're doing it and, you know.  Them: Oh, you mean on raise and hiring or in which Ray.  Me: Well, yeah, you know, like, you know, the metrics in the story seem solid enough to. To take some institutional money, right?  Them: O. H. So we. I don't know if Henry bag for you. We were about to do and we were closing on a seed round in the fall.  Me: So the question is. Y.  Them: We were going to raise 4 million. And then Unilever comes to us with this contract. And publicists started facing this pain pointer like, this doesn't make sense anymore. Me raising 4 at like, a 27 valuation. Is kind of silly if in five months I'm at a couple million ARR. So at that point I was like, okay. I went heads down on a surgery for Thanksgiving with the team on building out what we needed for Unilever just to even start getting to in front of their teams as we're broadening this.  Me: Es.  Them: Right before Christmas. I was like, all right. Let's just raise enough to deploy this to our existing pipeline before we even do anything. And then we can do fundamentally different round. In April, call it. So I'm trying to be like. That's why I'm trying to be super careful about this, I think. There's this type around Big Caesar now, but you're giving up too much dilution. I think before certain metrics are met. I'd rather do like, a more traditional, like late seed, a, I think.  Me: You still there?  Them: Yeah. Hey, cut out. Sorry.  Me: Just for, like, one second, but I got you.  Them: Oh.  Me: Okay. I mean, look from our side, like, I would. You know, we think less about the labels, like, you know, the letters, because, you know, they're kind of arbitrary. Like, sort of we think about it and just sort of, you know, the capital event, you know, sequentially into the business. Right. And so, like, you know what? I heard from you, just so I understand, is like, you know, and I, I think, for the most part, agree. I just wanted to make sure I'm tracking. You were going to do something. The business started to look materially better, and so you thought, well, you know, let's pull back and revisit and. Come back out, you know, swinging in, end of Q1, as you're saying, and in the interim,  Them: Correct. Correct.  Me: We'll do something. And why? Why is it at a 12?  Them: Can I give you a super mathematical reason?  Me: Sure.  Them: It's going to be absurd. We raised our angel round to get our early angels and strategics in at 6 million. And so I did something as simple as. Let me just multiply it by two.  Me: Okay?  Them: There's very advanced financial mathematics here, as you can tell.  Me: It sounds. It.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. So that's the whole plan. And then that's why I also raising 1.2, that's 10% dilution. Very vanilla. And also a lot of our angels are just stumbling down. Right. So I wanted to make it a no brainer for them where they still feel super excited. And amped to kind of join us on this.  Me: Where do you think you need help? I mean, you know, like, why. Why would you be, you know, interested to chat to us?  Them: So, Elliot, a lot of what we're doing, you might have noticed, we're doing a lot in Europe. A lot in uk Unilever right publicist lvmh where simultaneously building commercial network in New York and London. So getting the right people who are opening the doors in both is really important to us. We've had some of that with our existing clients referring as advisors, investing us, but like advising us and connecting us. But we need as much firepower as we can get. I want to go into our Series A, or whatever the hell you call it, in April with even more pipeline, with even more Fortune 50s using us, working with us. Right? So it takes a village. And I will never say no to incremental help.  Me: Okay? How about on the fundraising side, specifically?  Them: Fundraising we can brainstorm on. We had conversations with a couple UK funds and California funds. I think for the Series A is going to shake out. Wherever this round is going to be, it'll shake out to a mix of European American funds. We can definitely talk on some of the positioning stuff. And kind of best practices on that because my network, obviously, is a lot more on. I'm still here. Give me one second.  Me: Yeah. All good.  Them: Sorry. Yeah. Obviously expertise in, like, the local funds that you guys work with would be helpful as well.  Me: Yeah. Okay? Yeah, the Europeans. You know, we. We are kind of boring in venture. We have a much tighter risk appetite.  Them: Yeah.  Me: So price is usually the thing that rules most folks in Europe out. So we'll. Okay, understood. I have another one I have to run to in a minute. I'm sure you do, too, so let me. It was great to chat to you, by the way. You know, you seem like you're on the right track, and you're pretty, pretty competent and, you know, very clear value articulation.  Them: Yeah.  Me: So rest assured that, you know, the bar is quite low with early founders for this sort of stuff, so good job at the very least. But, yeah, let me go. Let me chat with Alex, let me chat with Henry. You know, I'll chat with the other guys on our team, see how if we want to. Want to. Do something. Matt, one of the partners I mentioned, who was the Orchard Founder, CEO, he's in New York most Wednesdays. So, you know, maybe you guys could meet up and get a coffee or something. But I'll come back to you in any case.  Them: That'd be awesome. That'd be awesome. Sounds good. Thanks for taking the time, Elliot. Talk soon.  Me: All right, man. Good to meet you.  Them: Bye.
