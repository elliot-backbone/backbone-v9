 Me: There he is.  Them: Hey. Elliot.  Me: Hey, guys.  Them: One second. My AirPods didn't pick up for some reason.  Me: All good. If we sit in silence, I suppose it won't help you figure out if they've worked or not, will it, Jason?  Them: Always when I'm going from.  Me: Yeah. Honestly, I've heard, like, a million times from people.  Them: My. It's fucked up.  Me: Yeah. You'd think that they would have figured this out by now.  Them: Yeah. All right, I'm good now. Can you guys hear me? All right.  Me: Yeah. We got you, man. How are you? Happy new year.  Them: Yeah, but jason. Sorry, one second.  Me: All good. You've got the fancy ones, Allan. Right. Those are apple ones.  Them: I do. I got them for Christmas.  Me: They're very nice, very fancy. They're an air traffic controller.  Them: Thanks. All right, we're good now. You hear me?  Me: I can hear you, Jason.  Them: Yep, absolutely. All right.  Me: How are you? Happy new year.  Them: Happy new year.  Me: What's new?  Them: Yes. Busy as hell. Feels like January just evaporated. Straight away.  Me: I'm okay with that.  Them: Some people say it feels like a long month, but to me, it feels like we're by super fast.  Me: Yeah. No, I agree. I'm okay with it, though. It was dark and depressing here. It's sunshiny. I feel much more positive. I can feel some sunlight on my skin. It feels nice for the first time. Well, look, so nice to see you again. Jason. You haven't met Allan before. This is the purpose of today, introduce you guys. I've known Allan for a long time. He worked with Matt and I actually, when Matt was the CEO. Orchard. Allan was one of the back end engineers at Orchard. That's where we. Got to know each other. He's a good friend of mine, personally. On the side as well. He's a good man. And, yeah, we reconnected. I'll let him kind of give the spiel, but Allan and I reconnected recently. Turns out that some of the stuff he's working on as stuff I sent you, Jason, is potentially of interest here for full disclosure, like it does seem to be of interest. Generally, Allan's connected to another couple of portfolio companies in the portfolio that are kind of, you can guess sort of which ones are doing similar things. And there does seem to be something here. But I'm the least technical person on the course, so what I will do is I'll stick around for any point of clarification, context. But otherwise, I figure I'll just let you two engineering folks speak to each other in your own sort of language, basically.  Them: All right, Sounds good. Okay, excellent.  Me: And so I think just to smooth that over fully, like Jason, I think it would be most helpful.  Them: Yeah, maybe.  Me: Like, obviously Allan can jump into who he is and all that, but why don't you give us, Allan, your five minute overview of XFX from your perspective and then we kind of take it from there.  Them: Yeah. It's difficult because I think. Our original vision of the company. We had one directionally, but I think we're dialing it in more and more. And I think if I were to summarize what xfx. Is all about is we're building. The plumbing, the infrastructure layer to connect DeFi and TradFi and to seamlessly allow for interoperability from any currency to any currency. So we're trying to solve the liquidity problem. And the fragmentation that it exists. Especially in defi. Blockchain stablecoins. All of these things that promise instant settlement are great, but they lack the liquidity and depth that we have in tradfi markets. Ultimately, our customers have exposure to ethics. They need to rebalance their portfolios in order to manage that risk that Hearst had, risk that they have. And anytime that they're doing that and going out to trad phi, there's a delay. And so our whole objective is to make that as fast as possible. So that the problem of locked capital, pre funding, all of these things that make FX markets less efficient and more expensive. Where we're moving that friction. And so I really feel like we're building that plumbing layer between defi, blockchain and tradfi. And that's the hard part about what we're doing, especially since banks are so analog. Right? If we could just build straight on blockchain and all the liquidity was already on chain. We wouldn't be a business, right? But that's not the case. So somebody needs to solve this problem. No, that's true. Okay, so maybe I can give my five minutes. Go for it. Leading up to where I reconnected with Elliot. 2020to. Say 22. I set up a crypto fund with some partners. It was sunk by the ftx debacle. Market neutral basis trading fund. We did some lending, arbitrage. We were dabbling in defi. All of that. I was a cto, built it all out. Was quite annoyed, so you can probably imagine. Close down the funds. We gave all the investors their money back, which was good, but it was quite expensive for the partners nonetheless. I've been back in traditional finance. Since then. On the risk side, corporate bond trading with some former Citadel colleagues. And again that hit Storey weather in the shape of various tariff tantrums. Since September or so, anticipating that I might start consulting again. In the crypto and blockchain space. And I've had fairly heavy involvement on the Enterprise side as well. I help j.p. morgan get there? Triparty repo project off the ground. I was basically the first person on that team. Helped Christine my build out her team in the Blockchain center of Excellence and make a tough technology choices, communicate with different parts of the business, et Storey So I had a long list of gripes. And pain points. For this kind of technology where it hits real software and simultaneously I was playing around with the new functional language called Unison, which is. Got a very interesting approach to its types. It identifies types with hash codes. And it does so in a very robust way. It's robust to transitive dependencies among types. The relationships hold at runtime as well, which is kind of incredible. So your instances that you can struct also come with the code, which is related to the types. And this is with distributed computing in mice. That's their target audience. And it got me thinking of some basic distributed computing problems that you face. Regardless of whether you're using blockchain or not. And I realized that you could cross sign these. Hashes.  Me: Sorry about that situation.  Them: With any key data or information, such as current Bitcoin block, et Storey that you had to hand, you could cross sign everything. And constructing the same type in two different places. With the same data. And it's effectively a proof wherever you want. And there's a formal sense in which that's true. And so I started building out this blockchain agnostic platform. Blockchain is completely optional. It's really just really distributed proof engine. Or attesting things simultaneously. Bilaterally is my use case of choice. I think I could probably extend it to multilateral, but you get so much from the bilateral case. Just having. Just having the two counterparties. That's right. Huge. Yeah. That's the 90%. That's right. Two remote kinds of parties. And so I've been building it out so the Quora is in unison. I've surrounded it with a little small fleet of Rust adapters. So far. For doing boring things like producing an event stream. That people can easily consume the downstream events. For ingesting things as well. Adapters going into this core technology. And that's basically it. So bringing all of that up and having it play nicely together. In a stack of these components is roughly going to be my product. So anyway, The primary target was fcms just because they have a lot of operational. Operational difficulty with reconciliation and boring stuff. And you mentioned Hearst set pay away risk. You can help reduce that. There's regulatory pressure. On the sec and the basel iii side of things. That is forcing all of these fcm. Entities to modernize anyway, so I was already targeting tier 2 FCMS with a friend of mine who's heavily involved in that world. And when suddenly Elliot and I do one of our periodic catch ups, and I realized that his portfolio, some of his portfolio companies are heavily focused on this space and more so they're technically savvy. And I'll be honest, I was finding it a little bit daunting. The prospect of actually doing anything with the tier 2 FCM. Because these guys live in a technical backwater, as you know. Yeah, exactly. And so. I have this suite of technologies is weapons grade research becoming a nascent platform. I'm, you know, working on authorization and stuff as we speak. Yeah, of course. Yeah. All of the base substrate that you have to get built out. Are you building this as a protocol itself or as like a centralized platform that interacting with the various protocols for which you're providing the cryptographic proofs so you. Can build whatever protocol you would like. Into the basic operations of the type system. It's a fairly friendly looking language. The developers of the Unison language. They're formally Scala and Haskell hackers. Been quite heavily involved. Especially they've both been heavily involved in stream processing libraries. So that kind of technology, both in Scala and Haskell again. And then they built this distributed computing language. So they've made the language look friendly. The type system is much, much simpler. Than Haskell. In a way, it's kind of simpler than Rust's as well, so. Anyway, you can specify whatever protocol you'd like. In the type system of this language. But the benefit to you accrues if you construct types that can be simultaneously constructed from the same data. In two different places, because then by communicating data among your counterparties, just point to point, there's no Consortium network to build. There's no. There's no crypto or anything. You get these distributed proofs of things that you want to attest to. Now what do you do once you have a proof? You can communicate it to someone. You can cross sign it against the current bitcoin block or any secure source of time. You could write it into a blockchain of your choice if you would like. That sort of level of availability, but where it ties into payaway risk. So imagine you've got two kinds of parties on a non cls settled route. Let's do Nigeria, Dubai or something. Actually, no. That's called Brazilian rail. Brazilian rail and South African rent. So the South African broker, or fcm has discharged their obligations by submitting the payment to the correspondent banking system now. It's T plus 1 or T plus 2 on the other side. In brazil. An actor such as yourself. Could choose to extend very short term and self liquidating credit. Now. What are you going to charge for this? Very short term credit arrangements. At the moment, there's something like an 11% failure rate, including things like the I ban is wrong and just annoying things. If you've got a quick bilateral proof. Which you can construct very easily, even from hokey software. So there's no integration problem to solve when you just have give someone a web and the endpoint to call. We're making the platform I'm designing. Will be deployed as if it's your infrastructure. Splunk is your infrastructure. Aws is your infrastructure. Databricks belongs to you. No one else can log in there. Databricks can't log into it. So I'm designing similar tenancy arrangements to that. Hoping to convince participants to send information here. Send information on the Brazilian side. Now you've got a proof and so the credit outlook is very different. Definitely. So you're actually creating an envelope of the actual wire instructions, for example, and that's what you are signing to create proof. And on the other side, you're verifying that it's correct. Right. They're not actually, like, you can't escrow the funds or anything like that. You're just validating. I say just. I don't mean it that way. You're validating that the instructions are proper. That's right. That's right. Validating the instructions are proper. And there's your receipts and that it corresponds to the request on the other side. And then you construct as distributor type that both. It's true in both places. And then it's still a credit decision. But you can see that the risks are reduced. But if you accumulate trust over the course of a year, Of these decisions, then you'll have hard data, you've got a year of transactions that have proofs and you've got presumably other non attested transactions and you can actually compare them and make decisions in a data driven way at that point.  Me: I thought that was interesting. When you talk to me about that, Allan, like the path to automation there. Obviously over time as you gain more at bats. You can start to carve out some automations there that can really drive fundamental unit economics at the end of the day.  Them: Well, no, that's right. So the network effects actually kind of gross. So once you've got a network of these participants, Then you can start talking about. Freeing up some margin. Or trapped collateral. And again, it's a business decision. But it's a business decision based on. Hard data. That's the value proposition, basically, for the FCM space, right? Going a little bit deeper on the tech side.  Me: Sw.  Them: How are you signing the proofs themselves? Are you signing the messages? Is it like a multisig? Are you using npc? How are the signatures generated? And how do you. How do you ensure that it's tamper proof and that one party can't corrupt the protocol?  Me: Eet.  Them: It's plain crypto with a verified setup. If both parties are using the platform. Then the verified setup is. That. So both counterparties would have infrastructure deployed in your platform. So that's how the integrity of the communications between the counterparties are insured, because that's the easiest setup. I've been dog footing this a little bit. So I'm actually attesting to things within my own infrastructure. So I've got types which describe my deployments, which I'm using gloomy for. So I've got the job post that's deploying things. I have a task that comes up and looks to see if things are deployed. And furthermore, you've got nodes that infrastructure targets are being deployed to, so you can attest what you're sending and test what you're expecting. Construct these remote types. Sign them internally and just slot these attestations away in a database. I'm doing that primarily. Anticipating talking to some crypto actors. At some stage, and definitely some banks who care about this kind of thing. We can grow this chain of attestations to people's infrastructure. We can prove that nothing's been tampered with, that no one's ever touched the admin account within your infrastructure, that would be. That will be 100% usage free. The way things are being designed. So that's the trust. It's a little bit different from the kind of trust that you're used to. It is. I mean, so this is where I was kind of, like, delving into it a bit, because I work. Before founding XFX, I worked at a blockchain, an L1 protocol. Company. And in particular we focused a lot on multi party computation, custody, security, privacy, all of these things. And so I'm a killer NPC use case you do? Well, this is what I'm kind of driving at is like, how do you do it in a way where you're not the risk in the equation, right? You're. You're intermediating the counterparties. But how do you do it so that, like, we can't say, okay, if you're compromised now, all of the transactions of all the participants in your network are compromised. Like, I'm just trying to. That's a. No, no, that's. That's. That's. That's a good question. And any software can be compromised. You know, there's. Of course. What was that? Poison pill touring award winning a guy. Some compiler in the 70s could have been compromised. And now. And that's it? That's the end of the game. Yeah. Yeah, of course. So the answer to your question is you still need to build that into your cryptographic protocols if you want that level of trust. So that would come from your MPC protocol? Or you know. Another one I've been looking at is Pedersen Commitments for verification of private amounts. So I'm sure, like, zero knowledge proofs or any of these things, right? That's right. That's right. To be kind of factored in, Right? That's right. They do. But the answer is you need to design these protocols. And all. All my types would add on top of that, you can just. Verify that these protocols have been followed. It's just, it's just a belt embraces kind of thing, but there's a little bit of a layer above, like where ZK and MPC would fit that you would, you would verify that this was a zero knowledge proof that was produced by this party, right? Yes. Something of that nature. Yeah, it's two separate things. And you need a well designed cryptographic protocol. To get the kind of security that you're talking about. But you can absolutely orchestrate the operation. Of that cryptographic protocol. Through types expressed in my type system and then attest to these. So now you've got two different. You've got two different groups. You've got a. You've got. You've got your cryptographic primitives and your signed data, which itself could be verified on its own. To show that the cryptographic properties have been followed. And that's if you're interested in using any of the. Robust cryptographic protocols that are out there. On the side. I can attest that this was orchestrated through my system, and it points to whichever data I choose to cross sign against. So there's two separate things. It is useful to have an orchestrating layer because you have to do that at some level anyway. There's got to be. Well, especially for. Yeah. When you're doing especially like multiple, like more complex transactions. Like we said, like single, like two. Two counterparties, one chain. That's simple. But when you're doing multi hop and multiple parties involved, it's really complicated. Yeah.  Me: Is that. Is that an example of what you have to deal with? Jason is your typical.  Them: Well, I would say that it's more of one that's going to be evolving as we tap into more markets, as our network starts expanding. We're going to start adding more currencies, and then as we add more currencies, the number of synthetic payers that we can start to add to our platform grows. And then that means that, like, for us as the intermediary, we may be facing our customers saying, I can exchange this currency for this currency, but in our platform, that actually means we're taking yours and we're swapping it three different times between these three other counterparties to get to the net result that we're sending to you. So, like, it starts to really compound. I want to mention some technology I've been building that addresses this problem. So I was anticipating. Working in the clearing capacity. As some point in traditional finance. So that's kind of. That's a matching problem at scale. So I created some types in unison where you can sign off in these bilateral batches. Of transactions. And you can only construct a bilateral batch of Some clearing invariants hold, such as conservation of values, the important ones that people really care about. But there's other ones. So that's great if you can construct these, but it's still kind of. There's still a computational lift to do, which is to do the asynchronous matching in the first place. So I've offloaded this back into rust land. So you have a batching and matching. Just plain. Old engine. Like a netting engine such as exist at any clearing has gathering all the transactions and preparing these batches. When it has. Some data that is confident will be in balance batch it goes and submits it and you've got something similar. Happening, happening elsewhere in order for it to be a bilateral bet, but because you've taken the work to prepare it up front. You're hoping that the failure rate of your batches is going to be relatively low in the east. Match is going to clear, and I'm. I'm getting about 20,000 transactions per second on my laptop. These binance batches. And so the use case I had in mind, or one use case, was a stablecoin Treasury. So you've got adapter layers. With the various Rust crypto libraries. For interfacing with whichever suite of coins behind the scenes. And then you're orchestrating netting and transaction gathering now for incoming transactions. This isn't actually too helpful, as you'll know, because they're already on the chain. But for outgoing and for internal organization. It can be super helpful, and you can. You can gain significant savings. Yeah, of course. And I mean, I think, I think your point around, like, stablecoin, Treasury Management, all of these things is, is an important one, because I think that's where. For us. We're seeing a lot of. I would say interesting activity where. Just the depth in the stablecoin markets isn't as sufficient as tradvi. And so we continually see USDT and USDC remain depegged, right? They're supposed to be one to one and they stay close. But in the FX space in particular, You know, just a couple of bits make a big difference for us because this is a volume game, right? And so, like, even as you're thinking about treasury management, I've been thinking about how we take our. So we're going to have a Treasury, you know, an inventory of every currency that we support.  Me: Arbitrage opportunities. There.  Them: Well, yeah, I mean, we're just. We're just gonna. We have to pre position the capital in certain places in order for us to make the system work optimally. Right. We can't just have it sitting in our treasury and then operations start for the day, and then we're trying to deploy capital. Where it needs to be like we're behind the wave at that point. But even as we're, like, thinking about it as an internal treasury management operation, Finding opportunities to arbitrage even within our own network. Right? If. If we see USD and USDT Deepeg in our favor, then maybe we're rebalancing that way, you know?  Me: Massive. Do you know genocida, jason? The company in our portfolio, cedar money. Benji feinberg is the CEO. It's the b2b payment stablecoins company. He does. Import, export between developing world and the developed World and the B2B payment component of it. So, you know, instant settlement and all that stuff. And he has this exact, like, I've had this exact conversation with him, you know, 912 months ago, because he also has the same data set, right? Like the same global set. Of stable coins in various territories. Like, the same life feeds a pricing that he has to do the same stuff internally. Like, it's, it's. There's, there's. Matt, there's huge opportunity there. The problem is it's a different business and it confuses investors. It's like.  Them: Yeah. Yeah, it certainly, yeah, it certainly wouldn't be something that, that it's more of an internal profit driver for us. Right, but, but, but it's, it's not a, it's not a product feature functionality. But my point was, is that like, Allan, as you're thinking about, like treasury management stablecoin and, like, how you're producing your proofs on all of these things, like.  Me: Correct? Correct.  Them: Thinking about, like, the fast turnaround on arbitrage and. And also, like, the thing that I'm still kind of wrestling with is that without being able to escrow the funds, He still runs a risk, even with the proofs being of course. That's something I've been thinking a lot. The entire Stablecoin. Everything, industry platform, everything is underserved by credit at the moment. There, there isn't comprehensive suite of effective ways to extend the kind of credit you see in traditional finance. There's no ways to extend your margin. At the place that you want when you need to extend it, even if you're willing to pay for it. You know, you can imagine it could get quite as expensive. So how do you. How do you broker that kind of arrangement? On the ground. You could do it. In a bunch of ad hoc ways. Or you could. You could try and. You can try and start building up some kind of platform around it. Because effectively, Credit is the only alternative to pre funding in this row. So to. To whatever extent you can take advantage of it. The payoff on the other side. Might be great. Also, the payoff to whoever is providing the credit could be great, because these are very short term. Oh, yeah, they're very short term, very high. Start time in short term and self liquidating. So that should be like a red rag to some financial bulls out there. But. But at the moment. It is being done on an ad hoc basis. But with emphasis on the ad hoc. There's no real framework in place for it.  Me: Jason, how much are any of this bleeds into overlaps, fits squarely into your roadmap? Your responsibility is, you know, xfx. Candidly, I think what we're finding when we're having these chats, you know, and I think Allan, I hope you agree, but like a it seems like folks there is something there generally in the space somewhere for us, I think we find a design partner or something, right? Like Allan, you were very much liked to work with someone. Roll your sleeves up and try to find tune this a bit, right?  Them: No, no, no. Agreed. I mentioned that I was feeling a bit stressed at the prospect of interacting with the tier 2 FCM. Or even worse, more than one tier 2 FCM. I definitely would value. Exploring a technology part of that actually gets it. I think the. The thing for me that is compelling so. For us, Allan. It's all around. Like if I were to summarize our value proposition. As a business to our customers. It's around capital velocity. Like, how much use can you get out of as little capital that you have tied up as possible? And so for us, that means being able to provide that capital to our customers as quickly as possible. So settlement times, like trading. Everybody's figured out trading platforms, right? Like, we can. We can make agreements in real time. The tricky part is actually seeing the funds arrive and settlement. So if we had a proof layer that we trusted, I won't say 100%, but we trusted. Right? You never trust anything 100. But we trust it. That says, you know what? When we see that, Counterparty a actually signed a proof that said the settlement instructions have been confirmed. Then we could release our funds. Without those actually having arrived, right? Because right now we do this song and dance, right? We're managing risk where it's like, I'm only going to pay you out when I actually physically see what you owe me in our account, and then I'm waiting an arbitrary amount of time for the correspondent banking. Systems to make them show us. But if I knew they were going to be there and I could trust that they were going to be there, I could release the funds sooner. And now I'm speeding up my settlement cycles. That would be like, absolutely one of the biggest things for our customers. Yeah, absolutely. And you, you'd have to charge for it at some point. In some. Yeah, you're extending credit to cover the payawe risk. But we are still risk. But it's. I would say it's, it's a managed risk and we would charge a fee on top of it, like. Yeah, exactly. It's a. Beautiful risk to cover self deprecating in two days. Everyone wants that kind of exposure. So, yeah, that's. That's one of the cases I was covering. So I'd love to. Maybe I could hit you with a demo at some point. That would be an interesting next step. I'd love to. I'd like to pull in our product manager as well. Andy into it. Just so she can start thinking about it too, because she's been working with a lot of our customers around settlement, SLAs and all the things that we're trying to do there. So I would love to just get some other brains thinking about how this would incorporate into our roadmap. I definitely think there's something here, because this is all around, like, having transparency, visibility and trust between the counterparties in the system and the whole way that things are done right now. I call it the rhythm method, for lack of a better term. It's a. It's the. It's a rhythm method of the. Financial system of, like, everybody just having arbitrary weights and risk management. It's like, I need to see this before I do this. And it's like, it's super inefficient. Absolutely. So, yeah, that's what we've been targeting, but, you know, not. Not quite with actors. Such as? Well, I think maybe the next step would be to. To go through a demo. I mean, I would love to see what you have. I realize they probably work in progress. I mean, I get it having from the ground up, too. No, no, no, no, no. It's work in progress. But there's a lot that you can actually point at is. I've got visual materials already. You can see the types. I don't think I'll need too much in the way of. Input from you because I'm actually targeting a standardized set of types. Again with the View to Bezel three coming down the pipes, so I'll just use some I was wrongly boring. Standardized types from that world. Yeah, sounds good. I'll show you what things look like for. Basic proofs and then for batches. That sounds good. Let's do that. Okay?  Me: Sweet. I'll. I'll leave you guys to schedule amongst yourselves, and, you know, I'll just sync up with both of you kind of separately. Right? But you guys can just run this without me from here on out.  Them: All right. Sounds good. Elliot. The connection. It was nice meeting you all. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, really nice to meet you, Jason. Yeah, sounds super interesting. All right, see ya.  Me: Hey. Papa.
