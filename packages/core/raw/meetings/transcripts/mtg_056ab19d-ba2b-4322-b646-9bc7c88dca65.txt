 Me: Oh, sky love you. I love you. Yeah, I do. I love my boy. Hello. Hi. My sweet boy. Are you? Okay? You okay? Papa. Who's wrong? Wheezy. Bub. Ba. My boy. There he is.  Them: How you doing, man?  Me: I'm good. I'm all right. How are you?  Them: Doing okay?  Me: I'm excited for our first investment committee.  Them: Indeed.  Me: Hey, guys, what's going on?  Them: How you guys doing? Good, productive morning. We had some good stuff on Double Sharp. That's moving forward on that side, which is nice. And then I just had a really good call with Mitchell and Norwest is arguing about price right now, but it looks like it's going to be a markup of Elliot. What Was that at 2025?  Me: Yeah. B2x. Right. But, like, I mean.  Them: To.  Me: That should be at a minimum. Right. We're going to try and turn that into something a bit better.  Them: Correct, but it's just at the moment that's the offer on the table. So I think he would still take Norwest's money, but he would just take less. If they can't move up on price. But anyway, it's an interesting first example. Who's leading it at Norwest Ventures. So the background on the deal is that. This guy Jordan, I think is his name. To. Make sure. Yep. Here, I'll drop it. It says. He's a vp. But I think that because of his recent deals, they're treating him more like a partner. He invested early in rain and stablecore. And in general, I think that of the 3 billion they manage, they're probably allocating. Like, I don't know, 25 to 50 million dollars to this guy is my guess. N. Ice.  Me: But they were own investors in Ad Melt. That was like the original context, right?  Them: Correct. Is that where Parker Burrill used to be? Made. They're big. They have so many. This is the guy that Elliot and I know, Jeff Crow. So he, in a weird sort of way, has mirrored our careers and started out in, like, advertising technology and then went into fintech. Over time. So I know him both from the, like, Google days that we had, as well as, like, Lending Club and Prosper and all of, like, those. Those days. He invested in a bunch of those companies. Okay? Cool. Yeah. All right. Well, when that all settles, I'll use that as an excuse to reconnect with Parker. He's a senior advisor. He used to be a part. Well, I think he was a partner there, but he used to be there. Now he's over at Dave. Like your deal. And today. He was at Prosper too. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. There's a lot of overlap in those networks. Yeah, exactly. Cool. Well, that's exciting for Metro. Yeah. And then I figured one, like, good way to, like, keep this meeting fresh, just, like, one aspect. On the like opportunities today. So on. Mitchell lava at 50 million. My feeling on that is like, if we were leading that round that, like, it's probably ahead of his commercial traction. Right now.  Me: Absolute.  Them: So. Not necessarily bad, though, right? Like, still, you know, for the check size and everything. But I. But I would say that this was like more of a FOMO check versus attraction check. So. So in just like, in the thought process of. This is the beginning of potential future rich rules and stuff like that. Let's. Say, what would we do with that information? Like knowing that in our. I'm sorry, in our underwrite, we might say that's ahead of commercials. And let's say maybe we had our right to participate or we had an SPV that was going to take something. How would we think through it in those instances. Well, part of it is like, we have to start recording these thoughts because we need the track record to be able to look back upon, and we need to be able to show people that, like, we had opinions on risk, on size, on market, on all of this stuff. So part of it is, you know, we probably, as a first thing, need to add a chat.  Me: I have a Granola running on this.  Them: Okay, perfect. But, yeah, I think in general. It's just. Can we talk through the current decision if we had it today, right. And we were being asked to follow with Norwest and write up 250k check in this round, for example. What would, what are, what are the things that worry us and what are the things that are exciting and, like, how can we just, like, try to, like, analyze it from as many different angles or experiences or networks or however it is. But I think that's the broad goal, and then we can get through as many of these as we can. Right. Like, I think we'll figure. We'll have to figure out the pace, you know, to talk through these things.  Me: Okay, so on lava, I mean, if you want to start there, right? For me. For me.  Them: Can I just. Maybe. It sounds like we're trying to first think about the framer for these meetings, and then we'll dive into it. But maybe I missed it. But was there. Is there, like, an investment memo or something that we can use to like? Because I. From my perspective, I know that we've talked about, like, limited traction. But I just don't even know what that means. So is it exiting for future meetings? I think that would be helpful. Even if it's just for sure. Exist. We either need it as an input to this meeting or an output. But. But, yeah, this stuff happened this morning, so I figured it was just, like, you know, more relevant. But, yes, I think if we're actually going to deploy other people's cash or think about it, we're probably going to want to do. That we'll have a memo before each one of these meetings. Yeah. No, I'm thinking just even given that this is, as I understand it, just building a muscle in terms of, like, once we have cash that we can invest, like, we want to use this as a real life experience, a real life meeting to see how we would think about a potential investment. That was my point. Like, it's tough for me to have an opinion in these conversations if, if I just don't know that much about where the company stands apart from, like, the, the weeklies where I think we've just kind of touched on. Again, my understanding is that the traction is limited, but I don't know what that means. I think it's like, at the moment, there is, like, a handful of clients onboarding.  Me: Yeah, I can describe. I mean, alex. Where he is is. A very small team. Five people or less. Very well capitalized. So, you know, growth should not be capital constrained. He is very much in that first phase of customers where, you know, you get your first 10 to 15 individual companies. I mean, you know, a couple of users within each one. You know, test it, try to get it, push it out to the org, like, focus on, on, on, like, you know, kind of micro feedback with the users. He's in that portion of the business growth, Right? Like very much. Step one, step one and a half. Our point of view on that is, you know, it's necessary and it's fine. If you knew Mitchell, which I know you don't, so it's kind of hard.  Them: No, no, I did. Matt and I. I went to his office and we spent some time with it. So I. I'm familiar with charming guy. Repeat, Founder is doing something in AI that sounds interesting. I guess my question has he found product market fit?  Me: So this is where. So where I was going is. So. So if you do know Mitchell a little bit, like, he's. He's very much a product person, right? And my feeling, having spoken with him a lot. Is that? He is kind of restricting the universe a little bit of, of engagements and sort of just general interactions with companies that he's having, which is good, I suppose. Right. Focus is important. But from my perspective, when I look at his pipeline and his roadmap and all this stuff. Sorry, his pipeline for, you know, for customer. Acquisition. I don't see in there. You know, if I. If he had to sign all of these guys up tomorrow. I probably see three or four contracts in there for, you know, sort of mid market kind of ARR. Sizes, you know, nothing, nothing pushing six figures or anything like that. So from my perspective, and I started with the capital constraint piece too, like, he needs to be much more aggressive in hiring, right? Like, he needs to bring in a salesperson, he needs to bring in an OPS person. And he's not doing that. And so that's just my frustration on that side is therefore, I feel like he's pacing on the investment side a little bit ahead of the game.  Them: But I guess going back to my question, has he found product market fit?  Me: No. I would say no. Because we just don't have enough data. Really. I mean, he's found a great product market fit with regards to a conversation. And now, you know, it's just going through the mechanics of, like, where the rubber meets the road, actually forcing it through into the customers, sort of, you know, hands and orgs. And, you know, again, I don't see that being done aggressively enough, in my opinion.  Them: But. But if you think about it from an investment perspective, right, Norwest is coming in here at a 50, in my opinion, on like a seed plus. Like nothing has been de risked from where it was three or four months ago. At the end of the day. You know, and so. You know, I'm still very happy with our investment and our timing, but it just, it's an interesting market observation that, like, With so little traction. 50, you know, comes in as a C plus. Is that 50 pre or 50 post? Let me pull it up.  Me: I say pre and hope, but I. I don't.  Them: No, I think it might. Oh, again? It hasn't been negotiated yet. Yeah, just like the offer. Comfortable netting out at a 50 million dollar valuation right now.  Me: Yeah, it doesn't say.  Them: Okay?  Me: But it's the same observation as the stablecoin guys, right? Like the payments guys, you know, the XFX's, etc. The multiples those guys are commanding is also just eye watering for very little kind of actual stuff behind the scenes. Which goes back to. Yeah, you know, it's fomo.  Them: So. Yeah. I mean, that's if we're thinking about capital deployment setting. That's kind of what my point is, is like, if we had a capital right now, are we entering into the frothiest part of the cycle? And are. We. If we would. If the decision would be, are we going to put more money into the series? A. Do we feel conviction around doing it at a 50 million dollar per year post? If a company hasn't found product market fit. Well, yeah. I mean, I think that's the guidelines that we got to set up in these meetings. Four deals that are fomo. Like, what is our strategy for fomo? You know, at the end of the day, like, we don't want IT to be 100% of the portfolio. We probably don't want it to be 0% of a portfolio either. Right. And so it's a question of how comfortable are we with this type. Of sort of risk. It could be regulatory risk, execution risk. Honestly, like, I think Elliot did a good job of, like, pinpointing the problem, and I feel slightly responsible for this is like, I just thought that Mitchell, as a charismatic guy, was just going to be able to hire much, much easier than it has been. And, like, I probably should have already set up some meetings with search firms. Like months ago. For him. Just because the pace of his hiring is just too slow. What do you think the difficulty is around his hiring? Is it he's just not able to recruit people, or he's just not focused on it? I think it's partly the market's more competitive than it has been recently. You know, like, I just don't know that many people right now that are, like, looking for work.  Me: He has in person requirements which.  Them: He has in person requirements. Yeah, that's probable.  Me: And I would also say, Alex, that I don't think he's been focused on it. He's a repeat founder, and he is one of our best. You know better CEOs for sure. But there's a very slight tendency, I think, towards trying to do too much.  Them: I'll just tell you out of experience, there's nothing worse. I still think if he is a product guy, what probably the hesitation is, I still don't know if I've found the thing that I'm actually selling that's going to work. And. And if I start hiring people, like, what type of additional pressure does that like? That's a lot of pressure. On on a product that still hasn't found its. Completely agree, which is like. But do you take another million, two bucks right now? Like, the answer is probably yes. For sure, for sure. I'm talking about, like, hiring other guns, like sales guns and that. It's like if you put up sales exec or a sales leader and it's just like a messy situation if you're asking them to sell the impossible brand.  Me: Sorry. Yeah. I think that Mitchell's very good at, you know, he's done a good job with his chief of staff. His chief of staff is. Is. Is. Is. Is. Is solid. I like him. He's junior, right? And I could see very much a world where Mitchell could hire a couple of junior people for these sorts of things. You know? And, yeah, you know, the salesperson is just out on the road with him, you know, making sure he gets to all the meetings on time. You know, like, just. Just handing off a lot of the busy work. Because I get the sense that Mitchell, he always comes with. Extreme high energy and admittedly, quite a lot of focus, too. You know, he often has notes planned and stuff. But he does like to live in the world of. Like, 100 miles an hour in all directions, you know? And so I just think, yeah, to Matt's point, it would be good to give him some, like, air cover.  Them: Can I reframe us here just in the interest of, you know, time and the structure of this meeting to say I'm taking some notes around what I think this meeting might resolve in. And it feels like we're entering a phase where part of it is like what is in an example, like this. What is the offer for a company. And then we would analyze our own take, but one segment would be like, how can we help the company? Like that's kind of the section of the conversation we're in now, so maybe we'd be strategic about that. Are there other specific areas where we should help? Mitchell hiring is kind of one of them. You called it out. But, like, does he also need. Other. Do we need to start facilitating some competitiveness for this round or something like that? And I don't want to. I don't know enough. I'm not close enough. So I'm just stepping back to say, sounds like we're talking about how can we help Mitchell right now. I have another segment that I think we want to talk about because we did touch on, like, our market observations based on this. What's our portfolio construction? And I'll share notes afterwards. But just here's a way we should help Mitchell now. Yeah, so. So the main thing that's going on right now is introducing him to preexisting conversations that he had had to see if there was anyone else who would be interested in. Like, he ideally wants to get up to 60. So that he can, like, make the raise be a little bit larger in size. Again. I don't think it really matters that much. But, yeah, I think that he's trying to create a little bit of competitive tension. So reached out to first. Mark Elliot reaching out to O. I just reached out to F Prime. So, yeah, it's at, like, that stage. Okay? And are any of those net new conversations or those are all, like, refreshing older ones?  Me: Yeah. They should all be like,  Them: I think they're all refreshes.  Me: Yeah. They know what they're coming into. With oak, for example, and primary. I've told them outright, like, I've been like, look, you know, we got this thing of 50. We kind of want to make it a bit better. Like, if we can get to 60, I think we'd be happy, like, you know, so they're coming in very much. Prepped.  Them: But, yeah, we'll see. Again. This is a very early stage business with five employees. Did he raise previously or. This is the first institutional round. I thought he had a round. Yeah. This is his second round.  Me: Yeah, he did it. He did.  Them: Who led the first round. The first round was Lear Hippo.  Me: Harlem.  Them: And harlem venture.  Me: All of. Yeah, harlem.  Them: Previous investors in his previous company.  Me: Cor. Rect. Leah Hippo wasn't, but the others were.  Them: Oh, really?  Me: Harlem was.  Them: Do we know if they're taking.  Me: Leah. Sorry, Justin.  Them: Go ahead, Elliot.  Me: No, no. Go on.  Them: I was just going to say do we know yet if they're. I know this is very early so. Because you got it this morning, but do we know if they're taking their pro rata has already been like conversation there. We don't have any risk. They are, do we? The existing investors. Yeah. All want to participate. Awesome. Again. While we're saying that, like, the execution hasn't been good, right? What I would say is Mitchell has a lot of support from his investor base right now, which is obviously, like, a positive thing as well. On the capital market size, but yeah, it looks like the first round was 5.8. Westbound has also been very helpful. I spoke to this guy and liked him a lot. I think we found out that. Let me actually. I think we found out that Norwest is a LP in Westbound. Which is also. Interesting.  Me: Yeah, Justin.  Them: I talk, charles?  Me: I think those are the two main things. Right. It's round dynamics. And, you know, the backdrop of just hiring and tying it to kind of tighter execution goals.  Them: I never heard of these guys Westbound. Yeah. This guy charles.  Me: All right, what's next?  Them: So I can do Moondy next again.  Me: I think had a. You had a section, didn't you? You had something else.  Them: Another section on lava. Oh. So I would say, like, just I'll reflect on this and figure it out. But I would say that my thought process is there's going to be a section of, like, a company discussion, and then there's going to be structure within that around, hey, Here's the components we want to understand about that specific company that just got a term sheet or is raising or whatever. Then there would be, you know, like, last part. How can we help the company? Then it would be, what? Are, I guess it would be. What are our market observations as a result of this? And I think it sounds like. Maybe there's room for that discussion. And, Matt, you were saying, like, there's this idea of, hey, some of these companies are getting capital raises on fomo. Which we're seeing in AI valuations, solid stablecoin. Are there other market observations? Maybe Whether those are just about like the market, or maybe, you know, the strength of the founder is so important. I don't know. You guys are closer to it, but something we can extract away from what occurred here that informs broader sets of principles. Well, I think the main thing is that the market he is building in, everyone agrees is a good market to build it. Like he has no pushback. On a lot of stuff. You know, and so again, yeah, I think it's my view is, is that if he hits, if he gets any amount of traction, That he's in a space right where there's just a lot of investment dollars waiting to be deployed. Now, whether it's becomes a good business or not, who knows. But at least it will become a big business, you know. But yeah, I think that's where it's still TBD, right? I would not raise 100 million dollar SPV for.  Me: I would say the other thing he does do, he. He. He has done a good job of leveraging us to, like, keep the sort of second level connections warm on the investor side, right? I do think a little bit that this round has sort of appeared just quite a lot because of the work that we've done around him and the space. The signal other CEOs to generate would be that, you know, they also kind of leverage us and then acknowledge that, you know, we can actually move the needle on. Stuff. You know, some CEOs will post fundraising the first time, then just say like, oh, I don't want to speak to another investor for three months, you know, and it's like, sure, but you probably should. So a little bit of a sort of second time founder kind of experience there, I think.  Them: Is there an opportunity? So I think we talked about doing a 2025 update to people to, like, prime the network. If we can get that out in a February update. If we update about January. I'm not saying that's the right cadence, but if we do, maybe Elliot, that's a part where we want to subtly influence our founders, who are also going to receive this email in the sense of, like Mitchell, we stayed super close with Mitchell, which was an amazing. Because it Elliot us to do X, Y and Z. And, you know, that may have contributed to getting this round. Preemptive, just kind of like. If we think that's valuable, maybe we should call that out in a subtle way.  Me: Yep. Yeah.  Them: Yeah, exactly. It's in a portfolio update, and you just layer it into the lava section, you know, on that. Note, too, you know, in terms of, like, which opportunities do we start to share? Right. Because obviously, they're supposed to start here and then have a broader distribution. I think it's a good sort of practice for us to understand, like, where do we sort of rank this thing in terms of, like, top half, bottom half. Right. You know, just in terms of our current positions that we would say, You know, and I think, you know, overall, I would still say it's like, you know, top half. Right. I think he's still executing and able to attract capital and, like, seems to be building in a space that, you know, has promise. I think, you know, for overall, I lean optimistic. Can we do a completely different one now? Just to change it up. So I caught up with the coo of rain yesterday. Their access to earn wage. That was an older company.  Me: Okay?  Them: Basically, the business has now gotten up to $50 million in revenue. You know, it's pretty sticky. Grows, you know, 20 to 30% per year. If they have a really good sales year, it will grow like 40 or 45%. But the company is, like, about to go through a bunch of. Check that just came in. On the equity side. The guy left the firm. Their new contact is the. The other partner at the firm who didn't want to do the deal. And now got stuck with it. They also have Adams Conrad on their board. From qed who's about to leave qed this year. And then the third board member is like, I should know this. Invis, I think, has a board seat.  Me: Where's Adams going?  Them: We don't know yet. Yeah, Invis has a board seat, but that guy has already left in this. So it's. It's on the second Invis guy. Already as well. So the short and the CEOs checked out. On top of it. All. And, like, the management team is, like, probably going to quit because there's, like, no management incentive plan or anything being put together. The CEO is checked on. Yeah, yeah. It's currently living on a beach in Brazil. Like he was able to cash out some secondaries. So anyway, it's an interesting one. So the opportunity right as I was talking to the COO was like. He's like, yeah. Like none of our investors have all told us they can't invest a single more dollar. You know, they're all tapped out. It's all sort of structurally broken. So I think if you did come in, you could sort of like, you know, name your price. In many ways. You know, for probably, like, 10 to 15 million dollars check.  Me: We could put kevin in a CEO.  Them: There's so many operational things that could be fixed.  Me: But that way we can get Kevin better wagely Kevin, and we can get him back over here, you know?  Them: No, but, like, I liked fred. I think if I did the deal, I would do it to put the coo as a CEO. Because I think Fred is very competent. At the end of the day, but at the moment, he's, like, hamstrung. But anyway. I bring this up as an opportunity just to like, have a broader approach. It doesn't always need to be VC stuff. Like we can just talk about, like, whatever the investment stuff that we're like, dealing with right now. It could be a public markets, trade or private or etc. You know, on this stuff. So anyway, I was thinking through that and my head went to like, all right, I should probably drop oka note and just let them know. Then I think there's an opportunity, you know, if they wanted to come in and clean that thing up. Is it almost profitable? It's profitable. 30 million dollar ER50. 50. Growing 30% a year. And he thinks that with a ten million dollar check, what, what, what, what will that give the investor? Whatever you want. The insiders are putting up nothing. No, but I mean, is there an opportunity here for, like, a management buyout, bringing in a private equity fund or all of the above management back? It's broken. Right? Like, the thing is not growing fast enough to, like, be able to grow out of its problems at the end of the day. And, like, you know, it's too big of a stake at Invis and QED for them to take the markdowns. Because that fund was actually really bad for QED. Literally. My investment is, like, the only one that, like, worked in the entire fund. And Fund 5. So. But anyway, back.  Me: Explored on the M and A side historically, like, in terms of exit, like, you know, do they have a point of view on that?  Them: On the ma side.  Me: Yeah. Like, do they know who they could sell? You know, do they have potential acquirers in mind, for example?  Them: Oh, it's been years of talking to acquirers, and, like, it's. Nothing has gotten done solely because of personalities. There's one company that they should merge with called Zazoon. As a weird name. It's an Israeli company owned by, like, a husband wife combo, and they're just, like, culturally. Very different than Rain. But, like, these two businesses should be put together. But like in Rain, you have Alex, who's checked out, living in Brazil, and you have the Israeli, like, hardcore founder who wants to run the combined entity. You know? Yes. There's lots of options on the M and A side. I think at the moment what's happening is Daily Pay, which was supposed to go public and I think should go public this year. And I would like to, one of these investment pennies, do an analysis of this, because I've been following this. Business model for a while. But daily pay is not growing as fast as rain is, so I think there's also, like, a natural combination there. But it's a question of agreeing on price and dilution. And M and A is hard. Daily pay didn't have a CEO for a period last year when it was. It was actually the right time to do the deal. So does Fred wanna run it that coo? So he'd be interested in things like a leveraged buyout or. And so if he doesn't do that, I would like to put him in the pool for like new co creation. Like we should back threat. He's good. Definitely the most confident person out of that.  Me: He's Shane Robinson's buddy, right?  Them: Correct.  Me: Yeah.  Them: What's the name of that other earned wage, early pay, company wage stream that you guys did? Wagely.  Me: Well, no. Wage stream is another one.  Them: Wagely. Wait. Stream is well, yes. I did that in the early days of qd, before I did rain. And I did one in Mexico as well, called Minu. Okay? That wage stream CEO, he was sharp, too.  Me: Peter.  Them: No, you're probably thinking of Portman.  Me: Y.  Them: Portman. Port. Matt willis, right?  Me: Eah. Yeah.  Them: Yeah, I like portman.  Me: Because the way street CEO is actually hilarious. He's a joker. I love him.  Them: Is this business? Pretty balance sheet heavy. Not anymore. How so? Because their book is, like, at scale now. They're. You know, I thought they had changed, maybe their model. But they. They do have. I'm just thinking if. If we bring. If we put together, like, a sponsor group. For some type of buyout. Is their growth left? I mean, if they're going 30, 30% a year, And I guess my. My question is. What are the capital needs for this business? But you're saying that it stabilized like it's really all set? The latest refinance of the debt saved us like 400k in monthly interest charges, which paid for like 16 sales reps. So that fully funded the plan. So it's like it's basically just being reinvested into right now. But, yeah, I mean, it's. It's an interesting space. Like, it's a. Payroll is. Is the category that I put these companies in, at the end of the day, is how I think about it. Interesting. Yeah. And so I think, yeah, if you can compound payroll companies over long periods of times, I think they, like, turn into interesting businesses. I mean, if we can. If we can find out a way to put some investors together and. And then take a piece of this business. Correct structure. It's not often that I see a business that has raised this amount of money. That has every single board member who's leaving.  Me: Yeah, It's a very particular set of, you know, things there, which creates a little opportunity, as you say. The why now? Strong. Sorry, alex.  Them: But I don't know. I mean, this is. Again, this is not a venture. This is not a VC business anymore. Or maybe it never. Maybe it was at one point, but I guess in this new world where people are just chasing AI, like, I. I don't know. If you're just growing 30% a year.  Me: Well, this is why I asked very concretely about the M and A stuff, because to me, it needs to be part of the whole package. There needs to be a path. I don't think we would do this and hoping that we could create the path. Right. Like there needs to be. That would need to be part of the whole thing, in my view.  Them: Well, given that the business doesn't consume capital like the 15 million that went in, or I'm just making up the number would go to the M and A transaction. That would, like, get the growth rate. I agree with Elliot, though. It's like they. They need to find a way to get to 50%. They have not released their secured card. They have not released, like a lot of. Basic pfm stuff. Seems like there's, like, two. Well, if VC raises off the table because it's just not structurally set up anymore for that, it's either a leveraged buyout. Right, So a PE kind of play with a management team leading that or it's M and A activity, right? That's pretty much the only two paths that remain. But. And I don't think it seem. I don't. I doubt we're in the position to benefit much from the M and A. Right. Like, economically, if somebody comes in and buys it and it's like, oh, they're setting it up, or. Or showing me there's pat on the back. But a leverage buyout could be interesting. If we know the CEO that we would put in and he's there and you're close to them. Fred that that could be a more interesting. Opportunity. For us. Backbone. For sure. And that's why I sort of brought this one up. Maybe on the big size, you know, but it's hard to know on these things, right? Like, why do you think on the big side? Well, I think that my guess is the argument that it's going to come down to is going to be, you know, is the check size big enough? Is there enough secondary for the existing investors? And what proceeds go to M and A and what proceeds? Because, like, those guys need to start taking money out of the business. Too. So it's like we would need. Again, if we didn't. If we weren't headed to. If we weren't headed to an M and A transaction and we were doing a leverage buyout, I think we would need to, like, pay them quarterly. And have some plan to be able to. Either monetize the business higher or be able to support those additional payments. Because I don't. But I think they would go away for reasonable prices and be paid off over time. Another observation, this would be. A check in column for should we get a broker dealer in the future?  Me: Well, man.  Them: And why, Justin? Like, if we. If we set up an investor group, I'm just curious for the buyout. Angle. That wouldn't make us a broker dealer. If we wanted to in the deal directly. It's better, I think. Yeah. I mean, just from an economics. We could get comp. Contingent on the purchase of that equity. Right. Like so. We could take comp. That's very banker structured. If we helped otherwise. It would have to be structured differently. I mean, we could figure out ways to get there. But it's so much cleaner and easier if you're a broker dealer and you just say, well, we're part of, we're setting up this leverage buyout structure. We're one of the bankers running the deal and we get whatever. 50 bips, 10 bips, 5 bips. And there's some transaction versus structuring it as. Oh well, Backbone gets, you know, because they're going to sit as a board member or you know, a consulting team, whatever. You just have to go through a lot more hoops and keep like a milestone based comp versus just pure contingent on fundraise. Or sale of securities. So. So one more on the idea side. So I was talking to Chris at double sharp, and he had gone very long silver last year. Which turned out to be a very good bet. Mostly on the thesis around. It's like increasing industrial applications was his idea, he says. Then it got caught up in like, other stuff as well. But like he did, you know, he. He thought that the demand was going to outpace supply as trying to use it for more industrial applications. But he. He thinks copper is, like, potentially next, and so he's looking at, like, junior copper miners and stuff like that. Was an interesting idea just to, like, look through and then also just reflect on Unvault and then look at the gold and silver prices. The why now was crazy. Those were crazy.  Me: Alex. Did you get scheduled with Sam yet, by the way?  Them: No, not yet.  Me: Fuck's sake. I'll ping him.  Them: That's fine. He sent me. I just need a pup. He wasn't able to this week because she's. I don't know what he's doing. He said he's traveling a lot.  Me: He's been traveling? Yeah.  Them: But he sent me a calendar. Like, I can. I can just.  Me: Yeah. Burton, the x policy guy from cabbage. Sam elig. Who? He's awesome. Justin. You met him, right? Before, I believe. Some kind of advisory consulting company, but he's currently working in South America. I think it might be Argentina. I'm not sure. On, like, precious mineral know, lithium mining, all that stuff with a US Entity and trying to figure out kind of the tech angles to it. And, you know, there's an awful lot of this kind of stuff happening at the moment. I do think that we need something in precious metals or minerals or something. You know, there's just a lot of people doing stuff in and around that space. And I think, you know, there's a tokenization angle for the future for us.  Them: I just found some time to chat with him. Next. Next Monday.  Me: Sweet.  Them: Well, cool. Well, any. Any other. Would you say diameter? I didn't get a chance to, like, write an update to the group. It's just been a little. Hectic. Here with this snow system and then going up. One of my dogs is. My wife left with my kids and my. I have one dog who's anxious. And she is just like, cannot settle down now. Sorry. I don't know if you guys can hear constantly barking.  Me: Life with. Oscar's not anxious. He's just extremely. Just wants attention all the time. He instantly.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Yeah.  Them: This is crazy. So diameter we got executed, which is great. Just a refresher diameter is in the cross border payment space. They are a US regulated financial services money service business in New Jersey. They sit above three US banks and a clear a lot of US dollar payments for cross border stablecoin companies. So infrastructure layer almost exclusively. Well their B2B some of their clients and users are Elliot individual Elliot owners. Most are businesses. I've known the founder for, oh, geez, eight or so years, probably, or longer. He's had some fits and starts with this business and then kind of like the stablecoin growth and some of the stability of his bank relationships has helped him grow. They grew revenue 170% year over year from 2024 to 2025. And we got a good We've been talking with him for probably. Four or five months. And he had a few cleanup items he wanted to get done before he executed. But we have a. He's an existing operating business. I think we have 50 basis points of equity, and we have a 2% warrant. In the business. And in the last 30 days, he signed three new clients, has two more that he's about to sign. And has contracted in another minimum of half a million dollars of 2026 revenue. So he's already accelerated the business in the last, like, 60 days more than he did in the entire 2025 period. Which is really great.  Me: Or is the tp? What is the tpv, Justin?  Them: Last year was over 10 billion.  Me: Okay? And what is like, the average transaction size? Like what? What's the use case?  Them: He, he gets paid. Like wire fees and ach fees, so he doesn't calculate it in that way.  Me: Okay?  Them: Yeah. He doesn't take bips on the payments his clients monetize that way to their end users.  Me: Y.  Them: And then we helped him. The forced starting point of our engagement, really, even before we, like, actually executed, was he was sending out a 2025 update, and we reworked it entirely for him. And it showed a lot of value because he immediately got an outreach from one of his network, who's a VC called Contour. Ventures who, like, immediately demanded a meeting based on their growth. And he's pushing him. And Matt and I have been giving him some advice around how to have those conversations, and he's been blown away because he normally is very accommodating and giving them all the information and answering all their questions. And as soon as he started saying, well, I'm not really raising right now, I'll send you those materials when they're ready. Like the pressure that they're putting on him. Because they're really very interested now. It's like eye opening to him. So we're in cycle of the memo. Should have a first draft with our touches on it this week. And then we're going to start the process of, like, initial outreach. Yeah. And in general, like, feel really good about, obviously, the advisory shares and then having a warrant in the business, too. It was sort of a no brainer from that position. I was like a thought experiment. Like, if a round comes together, like, would we want to write a check into this one? I would say, potentially, yes. Like, in terms of. Compared to lava, there's way more traction in this business. It's probably going to be priced much lower. And I think it has much more of a solid foundation for growth this year. At the end of the day, as we've already sort of seen and I've been in, we've been making some introductions to portfolio companies to as potential customers. And like those, those seem to be going well.  Me: Eah, round, sort of bead do we think in terms of size and like, you know.  Them: No idea because he's not a new company, so it's going to be. He has some ideas of what he wants to target. But I don't think we have any idea what the market reaction is going to be.  Me: What is you want to target?  Them: He. He would love a ten million dollar raise.  Me: Yeah, I think in 10. Okay.  Them: He would love 10 million. And I think if he got 10 on 50 pre, he would be. He would think we hit it out of the park to help him get there. He's. He's spent a lot of years. Really worrying about, like, balance sheet and does he have the capital? And he's hopeful to get to a phase where he can kind of, like, really invest business without waking up every night worrying about, like, what's in the bank account. But I think as a result of, you know, getting hardened by that process, he's a very astute operator. I think our challenge is going to be upskilling him in the investor communications because he's a heads down operator kind of guy. Who's, like, back of the envelope, taken out the pencil, and, like, I've got 4 cents I can take off of this transaction if I do these things.  Me: Impressive. Impressive back, like, you know, work profile, though, in terms of sort of all the stuff he's been doing. You know, like, you should work with him on his type five, like his. His, you know, intro story, because I imagine he's leaving an awful lot on the table. If you look at his LinkedIn, it's sort of just like one, one big name after another. But is he a good fundraise? Like, does he. Does he present well? I know you said he's. You got better since we did some stuff, but what is his general sort of, you know, is. Is he easy going, or do we need to kind of have him loosen up a bit?  Them: We need him to loosen up. He's like a tightly wound New Yorker. Build risk systems. Yeah. He's a very. He's a very tightly wound, New York kind of guy.  Me: Sounds like it'll be fun. That's a good play. Good, good, you know, job to have. Like, impressive guy that's probably not got teasing it all out, and it's just up to you to help him do that.  Them: Y. Es. I agree. I think he's. And he's also very eager to learn. He's very clear to him. He's like, hey, I don't. I don't know how to do this super well, and I would really appreciate your help. So he's taking it a very. A very studiously. Like, hey, what's the lesson I should learn here? Ok, let me apply that.  Me: You should. You should do the type 5 thing with him, though, Justin. Like, soon, you know, Like. Like. You know. You know what I mean by that, right?  Them: When you say type 5, you mean like the bullet point view of like, how I got here?  Me: His, his five minute intro. Like, you know, the story that he tells about him and diameter and how, you know, the thing that he can do in his sleep or at 3am when he's hammered in Las Vegas or, you know, you know, he needs to be able to do that.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Thing, you know, like a robot, Right? And it needs to be properly structured to do all the things that we want. It's in the handbook that I've drafted, you know, like the. The logic for it.  Them: Yeah, but we're. We're just at the memo right now, so, like, we're. We're just trying. We don't. Yes. He is coachable and ready to have the conversation, which is nice.  Me: Yeah, yeah, I think this is the right time because memo is sort of that helps arrange the thoughts and then you. And then you sort of anchor around that to say, like, well, now let's just bolt on the five minute intro to the start of this, you know.  Them: Yeah, perfect. Great. Thank you. Because I will. He's also like, what homework can I have right now? So I'll. I'll give him some of that.  Me: Yeah, Usually we just. You know, I would. You know, again, I'll leave it to you to figure it out, but you know, how I've done that is literally just to talk to these people for half an hour, 45 minutes an hour. Just, like, where'd you grow up? Like, do you have brothers and. Sisters. Like, what did you want to do when you were a kid? You know, did you want to be an astronaut? Like, you know, why are you doing this? You know? Like, what's the actual reason? Not. Not because, you know, try to get to the. The heart of the issue and then tease out all that we. We. Can talk about it separately if you. Want.  Them: You know, we could talk about. Sorry. Go ahead, alex. No, I was just saying. I was just going to say that Elliot, when we did the on vault one, I was. I thought he did a great job. I don't know if you have that recorded, Elliot, but I thought the way that you interviewed was really cool. So if we have it recorded, that would be. That would be amazing.  Me: Thanks, bud. I think so. Maybe I'll check.  Them: If you have that. Let me see it. So I've done something similar in hiring people. It's like upgrading is the, like, framework for hiring people. And I've used that, when I got to that as, like, part of my hiring framework, I felt very confident in, like, teasing that out. And I saw how valuable it was. Just so you know where I think this stems from, because I've had some of these conversations with him, and I think you're right. Is that he spent several years at World bank assisting in their Haitian rebuild after their devastating earthquake. And he saw like a ton of value in there, like credit development, financial inclusion, cross border payments of what was going on there. And that like, led him to all of his. I'm going to be spending time at the intersection of like Cross Border Finance, which led him to Cross Border payments.  Me: Nice. Yeah, he clearly has some kind of mission in him because he's done a lot of stuff that's kind of, you know, mission driven in some way, right?  Them: Yeah.  Me: So that's what you want to have him kind of underscore, you know, as he talks about himself.  Them: Yep, exactly. Awesome. Cool. Awesome. Well, I'll give you guys five minutes back. I just have a question I was thinking through. I mean, it sounds like from a Backbone perspective. And we should be. We're open to, like we were talking about the. Sponsor a buyout for for Rain. Which I think is the first time we talk about, hey, should we be doing maybe more like, things that are outside of, like, high growth, VC backed stuff? Which I think is exciting. I'm throwing this out there. I met I've actually been spending a lot of time with just. Unrelated to work. With head of business development and strategy. Do you guys know lpl? The wealth advisory firm. It's. It's a large. I do. It's a large platform of independent wealth advisors. They've basically been gobbling up all these independent wealth advisors under one roof. So he just wants to get out of there. He's been talking to a private equity fund that wants to bring him on into this new code that's going to go and buy out this other company that's more like techie, but still not.
