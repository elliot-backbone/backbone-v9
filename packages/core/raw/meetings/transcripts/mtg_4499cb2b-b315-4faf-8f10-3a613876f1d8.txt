 Me: Hey, buddy. No Neel yet. Literally about to ping him. But don't you. Have I accidentally joined your call? Another call that's going on now with David someone or other.  Them: Yeah, Justin's going to handle that.  Me: Yeah. So I've set up Granola. And it is sick, by the way. We needed all this stuff, like, a year ago. And it shows. I guess. I guess it's because I have the team's calendars loaded in my Google calendar. So it doesn't record the other people's meetings, only where I'm in it, but it shows me reminders for them. And so I clicked on the reminder by accident. Or rather, I'm a reminder, because I was like, oh, shit, Elliot for the next meeting. But it wasn't my meeting. But. Yeah. Anyway, how are you? You all right?  Them: Yeah. Tonight. Tactically before Neel joins. When do you want to have the conversation with him on potentially trying to make this reflect more of an independent board member?  Me: Yeah, so, I mean. Yeah.  Them: Role.  Me: I floated it before end of year. And he was like, yeah, totally. I think I shared with you, right? He was like, totally happy to have that conversation. He's like, just to pay devil's advocate. There's been times where he've only met, like, once or twice where I felt like maybe we should have met more or whatever, but he's like, yeah, totally fine to have that conversation. That's one of the reasons why I moved this to Monday. Was because I wanted us to have a more of a proactive rhythm with him for us as reactive.  Them: Yeah, I think that's right.  Me: So let's let him join, have the call and then we'll do like what we did with Jack. Where I'll be know. Can we have that chat this week? Can I share something? Can you review it, et cetera? I'll ping him because, I don't know, maybe he forgot. Ne. El. On. Norwest when he reached out to Neel, was. Did you do something in the background there too, or not?  Them: For lava.  Me: No. For pluto. Because in our group chat, You said you got off a call with him and he was like, yeah, he reached out to me.  Them: Yeah. I mean, I was just. Coincidence.  Me: So when you talk with Jeff, you should let him know that we're in Pluto. As well.  Them: Yeah, of course. Yeah, I mean, the meeting invite is not, like, a company specific thing. It's to, like, talk about fintech and stablecoins. I also got Castle island to agree to have a monthly call.  Me: Yeah. Okay? Nice. With us.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Did they confirm that they're not trying to negotiate us out with xfx?  Them: Sean had no idea what I was talking about.  Me: See, it's funny to me when. It's funny to me when the CEOs, they turn our guidance back on us. When we're like, just blame other people, they're like, okay, fine, I'm going to blame other people.  Them: Yeah, you could do that, as long as you don't think that they're going to make one phone call and figure it out.  Me: Yeah. Maybe that's the updated guidance. It's like, yeah, unless we find out, and then we're not going to be happy. Or you may as well drop. I mean, did he say anything? Did he say. Oh, he said he's okay.  Them: I think he said he's coming. No, I think it's good for us both to be on because then he'll feel more guilty for being late.  Me: No, no, no. Yeah, I agree. I agree.  Them: Hey, moni. Fellas. So sorry about that. All good.  Me: Hey. Neil, how's it going? Have we spoken since, like, verbally? Since the new year. At least I don't think we have.  Them: Week last week. Maybe not. It's probably past the statute of limitations, but. Happy New Year.  Me: Happy new year, buddy. How are you?  Them: I'm good.  Me: How was the city of love?  Them: It was awesome. It was so good.  Me: Yeah. Just a shame about all the French people there, isn't it, really?  Them: I know. They're actually very pleasant. I would say they were kind of in New York.  Me: Yes. Yes, exactly.  Them: But I don't know if that's a bad comparison.  Me: Where were you? What did you do for New Year?  Them: But we're back here. So we're back in. Basically got back on the 28. So we're going between for the 10 days around Christmas. Were you in town?  Me: Very little of to report, you know, just. I mean, for me, I meant that sort of tricky spot, right between kind of too old to be going home and putting a silly hat on with. With your mum and dad and too young. To sort of have my own cast of delinquents care about just yet. So I'm sort of. No, it was good. We float around, friends and stuff. What did you do, Burton, for New Year? Did you do anything?  Them: I don't know if you got that flu, Neel, but I got caught up with the flu. I skipped it. I heard everyone was sick in Neel. Literally everyone I knew who was still in New York was six.  Me: You were sick. It's contagious or something. Cool. Well, glad to have you back, Neel, for the year. I mean, where do we want to start?  Them: Yes. Where do we start? So a couple things. Just quick updates, just on, like, the number one most important thing, volume. Alexa signed his deal, basically. Christmas. Christmas morning. And we're still working with his lawyers in terms of, like, getting him the cash, so. One of the kind of big learnings here.  Me: On Christmas morning. Little busy.  Them: One of the big.  Me: Why is he not?  Them: I mean, it just took. It just took a long time. And then I was negotiating with the credit fund when they were at their Christmas party. And it was handy because all of the investor committee work, the Christmas party, so. As I was texting them, they're all able to make a decision together. But they basically asked for some ridiculous terms. And the twelfth hour and the ridiculous terms is like, A formula. For every dollar that he gets off a particular asset they need, he needs to sweep back 25%. And this is like a crazy, like, last minute addition, which is total bullshit, right? I had to present that to him. He wasn't happy with the last minute. He's like, hey, what? Committed at this point in time, like, let's just do it. So then he signed. He's happy to do it. He needs the money. The size is like 19.6 or something is where we're going to end up. And now it's. Honestly, 75% of the delays have just been because of Cooley. One, cool leaping, incompetent. Two. Cooley. Not just Cooley as a general, like that particular team that he's working with. And then the second is they need to come up with a legal opinion, which apparently is going to land today. So once the legal opinion lands, Then we've got the definitive docs. Everything else is there. Probably spend about 400k on legals at this point, which is wild.  Me: Cook. That's his his legal right, or we. Not ours.  Them: Not ours. I mean, I've got 75k as a retainer, but I get a paid back minute to loan funds.  Me: Y. Eah.  Them: Right. So I. Put that as a kind of risk a few months ago, but we'll get that back.  Me: Okay?  Them: So that's on that. Second one we have. It's another, like, bespoke loan that's going out. Chris Farmer is from Signal Fire Burton. I don't know if you've ever worked with him. Yeah. Large VC position. 15 million prices s +7. Right, so. Good, not terrible. He just needs the money quickly, which is good. He's going through a divorce. Have you worked with him before? Chris Farmer? Yeah, I know him. Like, it's been probably five years since we chatted, but yes. Yeah, yeah, this is for him. He's starting a fund of funds platform. For VCC, so VCs, basically, and he wants debt against that. So this is going to convert from a bespoke opportunity into a platform opportunity. And the fact that we've been able to work with him very quickly has been good. The other piece of competitive intel is he has another offer from Turbine. Which is the competitor, Turbine vc. I don't know if you've seen this, guys. But our offer is better. Right? And we've been able to move much, much, much faster.  Me: So that website in Turbine VC is not not a website.  Them: Maybe it's called something else. But the competitor's name is Turbo.  Me: Maybe we should. Maybe we should just buy Turbine, obviously, now.  Them: In cobound co. Turbo Co is the access liquidity without selling your stake. Those guys.  Me: Yep.  Them: Those are the two pilots outside from that, like, launch went good. There's been shit ton of inbounds, over 100. You know we're out there. Good, Good press coverage. I've got a TV interview tomorrow morning. I've got a TechCrunch type. I think it's PitchBook. And what's the thing behind TechCrunch? Crunchbase. I've got a pitch book in Crunchbase. Interview tomorrow. So, like, that stuff is going out. The number one piece that really mattered was the wealth management.com piece. Because that's what all advisors use. That one. I've got my media kit. I'll. I'll send it to you guys. That did well.  Me: What do you. What? When are you on tv tomorrow?  Them: It'll be wealth managementtv.com super fancy, but it's going to be like a 30 minute interview. I think it's taped tomorrow. And then it'll be syndicated in the next few weeks.  Me: Okay?  Them: So that should be. That should be fun. And now good to be an external CEO instead of just being inside building. Yeah. Outside, like, that's all the fancy stuff, the stuff that, you know, where I need support. So I exited Brian CTO on, like, mid December. We had the chat when I was in Paris. He basically just wants his shares. He doesn't want anything else. All right? So there's absolutely no severance. His. Last day is Friday. We've got the severance, like the exit of criminal all written up. He just needs to execute that. If he doesn't execute it, he gets zero. But yeah, last day, Friday, he's. Communicated to the team. We've put Jason in his interim. Jason's our. He's, like, the second most senior engineer. I didn't make him CTO immediately because I've been very transparent with him that, hey, I just haven't seen this from you. Right. That, like, you know, he's been deferring decisions to Brian. Whatever else, he's super excited by the opportunity. Let's see how it plays out. If not. We need replacement. Like the number one ask that I have from, from YouTube. I think the biggest value you folks have added in the last year, like last year or so, is around team, right? So, like, Vincent's amazing. Vincent signed, by the way. He's good to go. He's on holiday right now, but he's. Back on. He's back on Wednesday. But I need to see Tier. I communicated this to Motive and Potage kind of late last week. They'll find they actually didn't give a shout out to said, hey, look, we've exited Brian, Jason's the interim and we've got a strong, strong plan. So, yeah, it's fine. Almost. I think, Brittany, your advice there of like, not calling them to tell them specifically just kind of made it a non event, and I think that was the right myth. And then, yeah, so, like. Senior engineer. I've got an ad up for like a mid level engineer, but senior engineer. If there's anyone in. In the network, like I would 100% take that. Take that intro. Sid, the guy that you sent through, Elliot, didn't he like didn't interview well with any of the team and. They were just like, no, this guy doesn't cut it. So he was. He was in there. Right. But if there's anyone else, please, please send them my way.  Me: Yeah.  Them: I have four burning problems right now. Team is number three. So the first burning problem is legal. Right around. How do we create templatized legal? So I've actually engaged. He's an old Apollo partner. His name's Joseph. He now he's a partner at Paul Weiss. He basically runs private credit for them globally. They're writing our documents. The reason I picked Expensive Council is because Apollo. And Hamilton Land all trust them. And they know this guy. Right. So they're going to write our templatized doc. So that's kind of issue one. It's moving. It's just moving very slowly. So that's kind of burning issue number one. Burning. Issue number two is around. Moonfair, moonfair and unicredit of fighting at this point in time. By the way, we had a little bit of a up on the press release. I checked with Allocate. I checked with Apollo, I check with Hamilton Lane. I actually forgot to check with moonfair to clear the press release. And their PR team reached out to our PR team. Saying, hey, who. Who approved it? I dropped an apology I sent to the CEO. CEO. I didn't really care, but we had to go. Then brief tape the press release to basically take Moonfare out, which is fine. Outside of the. Outside of that Moonfair is basically a little prickly with UniCredit. So I'm catching up with UniCredit tomorrow. I think in the next month or so. I need to go and visit just to sort it out. And see what's going on. Issue number three's team, which kind of I've highlighted nation before, is just around the regulatory structure. So we need to lend through a partner bank for this. The good news there is we already have a term sheet from CBW Bank. Now, CBW is not always the most reputable bank, but we have a term sheet out to Patriot Bank. The reason why Patriot is actually really exciting is that there was a competitor to us called Optic Uptiq. They tried to do alt lending for a long time. They shut that business down in the middle of last year. The guy that was running it, he was one of the co founders. He left Uptick and he went to join Patriot bank as the president. And he's the one that reached out to me. So he completely had a sense of space. He understands everything that we're doing. Ideally, we would use them as a lender of record. They charges 10 basis points. This should be relatively straightforward. But kind of. Those are my big four that I need to solve in the next month. With team being number three.  Me: And what about goals? Like, you know, outside of fires? What does Q2 end and Q4 end look like? Let's say from, like, a numbers and, like, cash perspective.  Them: Yeah. So from a numbers perspective, Sat smaller. Let's go. Q1. We wanted to get 30 million bucks out the door. In volume. The Q4 number which I've put in. Kind of the models and everything else is large. It's like 5 to 800 million, depending on. Depending on where we land with partners we're working on, you know, single $100 million opportunity now, which is that Andre Cent Horowitz opportunity. I think I've mentioned this. Kind of all of these four immediate fires. Lend towards that. I've got a 14 page kind of doc, which I'm taking to Portage and Motive. I'll send that to you now. I'll just put that together. I'm meeting Motive tomorrow. And portage on on Wednesday because there's no board. This is just me catching up informally. But you can call this, like, quasi, you know? Hey, like, this is. This is what, you know, this is what we're up to. And it's got goals and. And everything else in there.  Me: Okay?  Them: I know, I know. It's super, super short order, but I think I have a little bit of a, you know, coverage window for the first one. We can. Then we can kind of share that in advance for the second one, but I want to meet them at least quarterly. And sit down and talk. Talk about this. The biggest ask that I have from both of them. I'm literally just going to be around. Hey, team. Right? Because I feel like.  Me: Who is our main sponsor at Portage Neel.  Them: Steph. Steph.  Me: Steph. Okay? Jason on our side from plaid. He works with Portages advisor. So I'm going to see if Jason can just give us anything extra. There. Step. Okay.  Them: En.  Me: Just to pull back to team quickly. Where are we on your assistant Swiss armyknife Chief of Staff person?  Them: Bunch of interviews I have, like the two shortlisted candidates is this lady from Goldman that reached out. She's like an analyst. She reached out based on the press release. I met her. I liked. The second one is actually. The second one is actually potage analyst. He's the analyst that worked on our pre seed deal. And now he works at a different startup. So he. I mean, he had a sense of business. He's grown up in banking, like that kind of stuff. And those two are the short list on Wednesday this week. I owe them, like, a one pager. Of like, hey, here's a case study of go forth and do it. And then we'll go forward from that. So close. Closer than I was before.  Me: Yeah.  Them: But.  Me: Okay, that one's. That one's a big one for me. Because.  Them: It gives me leverage. Then. And then also too. I'm talking to Jordan from Norwest today at 3, Neel. So I'll let you know how that goes. I know that they reached out to you post press release as well. When I. Yeah, I mean, I think they're leaning in quite heavily now into, you know, you know, basically had a huge win when they invested in the seed round of Rain that stablecoin back to credit card. Yeah. Yeah. For I think that that has now reactivated their fintech group in terms of having a lot like more dollars this year and a lot more ability. They also said that they're now seeing, which is what I sort of predicted would happen. At this point in the cycle, very few companies actually go to market. Everyone gets preempted. There is no processes anymore because the number of companies is smaller than the number of slots. That puns have to invest. Great. One fund had reached out to me, said, hey, do I still have an allocation open? Brian? It's like a rando crypto fund. I knew this guy for my last company. I just said yes. I said, hey, we have a safe open. You should also think about. I mean, probably not for this round, but definitely for the next round secondary as well. Exactly right, yes. You mean fill like an A? Yeah, yeah. So that you can get some liquidity. Yes. My mind is not there at all. But yes, I will always be thinking on that. On your behalf, I appreciate. Don't you worry, I'm laser focused.  Me: It's come earlier and earlier as well. Now, we've seen. We've seen, you know, secondaries happening very early, let me just put it that way.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Again, not huge secondaries, right? Like, it's not like get rich secondaries, but it's like. It just helps. It's like it has to posit secondary. Correct. Exactly.  Me: Yeah. No. It's sizable. So where. Where do you think that leaves us, Neel, for, let's say maybe the. The first half of the year in terms of priorities around, you know, I mean, I guess back to the capital raising sort of cornerstone in all this, then where's your head at for this year with regards to capital raising?  Them: So, I mean, we have 7 in change in the bank right now. 7.1. Right. So I. Was talking. I was thinking about this. The number one thing I need to do this year, otherwise in fucked. Is I need to demonstrate. Not these, like, heroic one off massive deals. Right? Or even the bespoke opportunities.  Me: Yeah. There needs to be a flow and a product.  Them: Exactly. It needs to be a repeatable process. The closest to the burden, the hand is this. Andre Sanjara. What's opportunity for 26 million NAV? 335 LPs. This like literally defines those four fires that I have. In the sense that once we get the partner bank in place, once we get the templated legals in place. Hamilton Lane has already given me an offer at S +4.50. It's a really great deal if we get that out the door. Even if we get 10 of those 335 clients in, like, that's a repeatable process. The legal incremental. Legal cost. There is zero. And then at that point in time, I can go sing to every single PE Fund, every single VC fund. And I think that back to your original question of how I think about capital for this year.  Me: Here.  Them: Sure. Being preempted is fine, but I want these folks to be customers before I want them to just give me cash. Right. So it would be much better to have one of the big three VCs who have that Ria arm attached. Like I saw Andresen just did a $15 billion. Announcement across a bunch of their. Their funds. But Andren has. Wherever, perennial, whatever it's called. Sequoia has heritage. You know, GC has GC wealth. Those three, I think, would be the targets. If you think about vc, right? Because they have these huge things on the side. So I think once I've done Andresen, it's a very nice footing in the door there. And then Burton, like, if we activate David Haber or whoever else at that point in time, I think he is the. I think he's still the fintech guy or Lisa lending guy. And I know he had a sense of space, right? So I think that would be.  Me: 's another. There's a guy in New York as well called Mark. Who's a fintech guy, too. Mark Andrew.  Them: Neel, did you see the big write up? The not boring write up of Andreessen?  Me: I'm literally about to send it right now.  Them: We'll put it. It's a very good read, and I think we'll help you a lot. Interestingly enough, David is quoted quite a bit on terms of, like, what it's like to build a firm versus what it's like to build a fund. And I think that, like, you have the ability to pitch that you're helping them build a firm. At the end of the day. Right? You know, so. So I. I finished that article and was like, oh, my God, this is fucking great news for Pluto. Great. Great. All right, let me have. Let me have to read.  Me: So.  Them: I think there's a few things like even docs that I'm sending to, to the board stuff and I'll send you that now. I think there's a hiring off. I think the number one thing is on there. I know, Elliot, we talked about like marketing pipeline and everything else and happy to jump on a different call. I think we're pretty. We feel good for that state. Patrick, who's come in, has helped. We've got, you know, in house work, design, we've got all of our, you know, if you ping the website, it's going straight into our CRM and there's. An automatic drip message that follows up with you. Like, all of that stuff is relatively locked down. But we, of course, we can get better. So maybe we can do a follow up on that, but call it Thursday.  Me: Yeah. I mean, I wanted to listen to what the priorities are first. I mean. I mean, I think. I think. Let me think about. Let me think about it. But it seems. It seems as if the priorities are much more on the. You know, enterprise partnership side of the equation with respect to, you know, the VC guys. Right, like the A16s, the sequoias, et cetera, based on what you said. I don't see the need to spin the wheels on other areas of the commercial facing portion of the business, at least for the time being. But these are just live reactions. But I agree with you that there's a nice dual story there with capital and then, you know, a 16Z, particularly on the write up definitely arguments that can be made. I think that's probably the place to jam on with you more is sort of what's the thread of the story that we tell those three guys? A16 is the sequoias, et cetera. Let me think about it, though, because we're talking about a whole year here. And we shouldn't run through it. Let me revert and come back to you. And I think once we have a bit more of a structure around what we want to achieve, We can figure out how to actually go and do it.  Them: Sounds good. Sounds good. Some additional non me fintech news. Juno. Waldo. The guys that are doing kyc. They were doing kyc? No, Jeff. And Jeff and Ryan. They used to run Gatsby. They launched. This is. Like, like. Narrative violation type of thing. They launched a Treasury business. So think about, like, ROE or Mercury, like any, any of these. And any of these ones, like, basically, businesses like us go put money in, they automatically invested in the ETF because they've run one of these businesses in the past. They actually got this down to, like, I don't know. It's like a $7,500 a month operating cost, which is nothing, right? How do you sell this company name? Welder w a l d o. Kay. So they, they had, they started with a KYC business, then they added a finance, like a Treasury business. That treasury business is growing so quickly, they're actually getting rid of their KYC business. So if you know any buyers for KYC business, That's a horrible name. There's like, 15 companies.  Me: I actually kind of like it because it's like, where's Waldo? But.  Them: I know. Yeah, I think I found it. Smarter for us. I think for the. For the Brits, it's worth Wally. I don't know if it's. Where's Wally? In the uk.  Me: As well. I always had that. I had a hilarious poster one in my room once. It was a picture of Waldo sitting at a bar draining a shot. And the quote is just nobody ever asks, how's Waldo?  Them: That's good.  Me: I'll leave you with that. But, yeah, Neel, I'll pick up some more time with you later this week, and we'll kind of do more planning stuff and, you know. Yeah, I just want to sort of, you know, both of us, all of us align in the term what we're doing.  Them: Yeah, sounds good. Yes.  Me: All right. Good.  Them: That sounds good. And the other thing is I. I did hit the 1st of Jan deadline for, for the investor update, so I'll open you guys earlier. I just want to be a little fundamentalist about sending it out on the 1st, so I'll. I'll do that on Dev.  Me: And good news on our side, by the way. We're all fully wired up with. With call notes, recordings, stuff. Now everywhere in the background. All it's all feeding into, we run in Granola here. Meaning that, like, you know, never again will we, you know, not remember what we talked about?  Them: Amazing.  Me: Yeah. Good stuff. All right.  Them: All right. Thanks, neel. Take care.
