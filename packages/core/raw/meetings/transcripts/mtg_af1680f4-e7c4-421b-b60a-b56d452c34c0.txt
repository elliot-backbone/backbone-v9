 Me: Yeah. How's it going? We put backburn yesterday. That was exciting.  Them: Yeah, I saw that. It's not that he never give it a like.  Me: Yeah, I think I invited you specifically.  Them: Did you? I'm not a big LinkedIn like that, but I'm definitely going to give you.  Me: Yeah. I don't have social media of any kind. I've long weaned myself off the dopamine hits from likes and stuff.  Them: Yeah.  Me: But this time I was willing to. It's a year of work behind the scenes, so I'm happy to get some likes from people.  Them: Yeah. It's awesome. You got a good response.  Me: Before we get into. Sorry, what did you say?  Them: You get a good response.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Like good activity around it.  Me: We've done a couple things right. All of us. The four of us have listed. Semi fictitious stealth startup as well alongside the Backbone position of the logic there. I mean, I say semi fictitious because we are all working on stuff, but I wouldn't say that any of us are planning on becoming a CEO of anything anytime soon. But we want to capture all the inbound, which actually dovetails into our conversation because we want to capture, we want to get scraped by all the CRMs. Just to become visible again. So I've got quite a lot of inbound that's sort of interested in what the thing is that I'm supposed to be working on. So that's good. But, yeah, if you don't mind, maybe we can just spend 20 minutes talking about. Vccrm. Don't sort of anchor too much on. What I'd shared before. If you have even have looked at it, then great. But if you haven't, then don't worry so much.  Them: Yeah. Y. Eah, I did. I did look through it.  Me: Cool.  Them: A week or two ago when you sometimes just flipped through it again.  Me: Yeah.  Them: But we can go in whatever direction. I don't know if it's changed a lot, but.  Me: Well, I guess what I would say, and then I'll sort of kick it off, is just on the current state. I mean, one of these things that changes every day as I do more work.  Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Me: But the major shift. Is currently going underway is to move it from. And we may have touched on this a bit, you and I, but reactivity into proactivity, right? And the goal of this is very much to be an operating system for, let's say, someone like you. As an example. Right. And so if you think about your life,  Them: Y.  Me: It's all well and good. To be a firefighter. Right? And that is useful, right? In and of itself. You just getting. Simply getting stuff surfaced that tells you more accurately where the fires are and what the consequences of those fires are. Like, that's fine. That's good. That's better than what we have today.  Them: Es. Y. Eah.  Me: But I think ultimately the real value will come from. Marrying that and the impact of a reactive action against the impact of a proactive action. So put out these fires or over here, there's an issue which could become a fire in a month. But if you do this thing now, it won't. And it will actually have a positive effect for two other things too. Right. And that's basically just a data problem. It's a data problem and a feedback loop problem of knowing, actually just verifying what the impacts were and if your assessment was right, but. From a sort of architecture perspective. It's not an insurmountable problem, because in today's day and age, the amount of unstructured data that we can be pulling into this thing.  Them: Yeah.  Me: To minimize the lift of having to submit data. Right. Because one of the pieces of feedback I've gotten, and then I really will pull up and sort of pause for a second, I've kind of jumped straight into it. But one of the pieces of feedback that I've gotten overwhelmingly is near on impossible. Very difficult to get portfolio companies to continually submit or get data from them in the way that you need it.  Them: Y. Eah.  Me: To track the stuff. And so sort of the way I've thought about it on our side is much more or that one. We're not heavily relying so much on hard numbers from the company as much as we are tracking their progress against their goals. So a goal is going to be a hard coded sort of input that we create. For each company and sort of track that sort of quasi manually. But then the indication of sort of the health of the company and the value of any knock on effects actions that you might take is really correlating Back to does this get them closer to any of their goals and how is that progress weighted against us? Progressing something else in the portfolio that might be more valuable because we got higher ownership or whatever it is, right? So just to pause, I guess why I started this thing was because Backbone has no tooling. That really does the job. It's all split between Google sheets and, you know, the whole situation. The CRMs that you would. Well, you know, I'm not going to call it a CRM. I'm calling it an operating system. But whatever. Like the CRMs for VC today. If you want to call out that bucket. Are stunningly underwhelming, right? I don't know why. Right. Like, I think maybe it's a function of VCs. You know, it might be a reflection of the VC community generally in terms of it's sort of dilettante nature with how it interacts with its subject matter. But, you know, there's nothing good. My immediate short term ambition. Let's say by the end of next month or certainly by the end of this quarter. By the end of next month. It can't really be later than that. Is that this thing runs in the background for Backbone. Right? Like properly.  Them: Yeah.  Me: As a kind of prototype that, that we use. And then, of course, the question is immediately like, is this just something for us? Is it something for the market? Is it a company? Is it something that is a Backbone feature? Like, because where it's going, and I'll stop now, is, you know. There are obviously different views and tools, if you like, for different players in the value chain. And you know, this is very much tiered towards an operator friendly venture investor or advisor view. But of course, there would be event there would be an investor view generally where perhaps in time, you know, as opposed to me sending you an email with a memo, I just send you a link into the platform and it's already got all the info there. It's already auto generated, et Storey And then, you know, so. So who knows, right? But I'll pause for a moment.  Them: No, I think it makes. A lot of sense. I think. Like my specific keys on why there hasn't been a good platform. OVC's yet today is, I think, just like MVPC's need are different and we're also just bad customers. Like it's not a big market, so this hasn't been enough investment in it. I think it's much easier to make. That investment now because it's much easier to build these tools, right, with like a low lifted kind of resource and all that.  Me: Done invest now.  Them: And so, like, I agree with everything you say. I think.  Me: I really.  Them: Where things would be most valuable. In at least. Like, my workflow is actually, like, having a tool that pushes me to be more proactive about things. It's actually pretty easy to be reactive because I think the status quo is, like, every day there's a list of things that come in and they fit. It's pretty clear, actually, like, where things fit on a priority, whether it's like a live deal you're working on or portfolio company situation and.  Me: Is actually having. A tool. Situation.  Them: Then you have kind of pre scheduled meetings and calls, and it's really like, how do you.  Me: Calls. How do you.  Them: Like, it's easy to be reactive, right? And that's what most people are. They're just reacting about things. But I think what makes a really good investor long term is actually having the focus and ability to be proactive and, like, carve out that time to be proactive and really kind of manage. Their time.  Me: Having the focus. And going to be. Proactive. On the reactive proactive side. I've been speaking with it with a couple of. And, like, I've been trying to understand on the reactive side, like, I hear you, like, logically, yes. Things get to you when they get to you. And, you know, if they're on your plate, that probably means you got to deal with it. But. Is there any sort of systematic. Monitoring, I suppose, of the portfolio as a whole. Like what I tend to hear.  Them: Y.  Me: Is that the green companies and the red companies.  Them: Eah.  Me: They get visibility, Right, like the ones that are going well. You know, get visibility. The ones that are house on fire get visibility. The ones in the middle that are just kind of trending somewhere, they kind of get forgotten about.  Them: So. Yeah. So I think it really depends who you talk to. So it's like my. My, like, kind of strongest reaction to a lot of what you're talking through is it seems like you're focused a lot on the portfolio side of things, which ultimately is like, One of the more. Elliot, I would say, like, the importance of BNBC is you have to do good new deals, right? And then you have to manage your portfolio and it's really like 50, 50. I think some fund will think it's maybe 70% doing new deals, and they just don't actually spend time with their portfolio. And I think. The more you go to. PE funds. It's maybe like, more portfolio than new deals. But I would say, like, on the portfolio side, every VC is very different. I think how we operate, and this is just a data point, is, like, the partners, we all sit on boards and we have a few relationships, and those relationships are actually, like, pretty strong and in depth. Like, we talk to our CEOs every week. Or every other week. Sometimes even every other day. So the line of communication is actually, like, way more fluent. And so it's much easier to be, like, reactive and proactive at the same time, because they're always kind of top of mind. And it's because we don't have hundreds of portfolio companies. Right. So at any given time, I'm focused on the portfolio companies that have the strongest needs or we can create the most value. But that changes every week. Right. And so, like, in a given month, I'm probably spending equal, relatively equal time with all the portfolio companies. And so, like, my gut reaction, like, having a tool and, like, a big system. To manage that. Is probably not as valuable just because everything kind of already sits in, in my head and it's easy enough to manage, or I think it's easy enough to manage. Right. There's always things and I think where the reactive part, I think at least what I've been doing is not like I use Granola a lot.  Me: Yeah. Yeah.  Them: I Actually, the one thing that. That is hard to do is keeping track of all the follow ups. So, like, you have all these calls and like, once. What intros did you promise? What are the follow ups? And being able to organize some of that, like, unstructured data to actionable things to do. I found is, like, kind of very valuable.  Me: Yeah. Yeah. So. So I have a whole. I got a whole Granola pipeline for our stuff here, too. That was kind of in our answer to the question of, like. Well, you're never. You never get information from the CEOs that you need. It's like, well, I talk to the CEO every week. I can. Just ask him what the MRR is and like, that will get plugged into the data, you know, like, but to your, to your, to your new code or to your new deals point. So I, I kind of didn't really, you know, it's a good flag. I forgot to sort of include this in my in my overview. But the two vectors, if you like, if you visualize that, the platform screen on the left hand side, you've got all the internal portfolio stuff.  Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Like that's helpful. Yeah.  Me: And that's broken out into companies, firms, investors. Rounds, so specific rounds between the two. And then specific deals within those rounds. They all have sort of profile IDS and persistent things. And then there's people, entity, which is, you know, CEOs, operators, partners at firms, advisors, you know, whatever it is.  Them: Y. Eah.  Me: Along the horizontal navigation up the top is the same but for the. For the market. So for non portfolio stuff, so external internal.  Them: Yeah.  Me: And there, you know, there is a, you know, there's a whole pipeline tracking for new codes. Basically, a very similar view. Right, but for new deals. Right? Not for stuff that's internal.  Them: Yeah, yeah.  Me: And. The ambition there, as I say, is very much that it serves that. That function that you were looking for on, on. On the deal side. So maybe we can talk about that, but just round it out.  Them: Yeah, yeah.  Me: As you said, rightfully so, like one of the reasons why. This hasn't really gone anywhere as a category. It's because everyone's needs are different.  Them: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.  Me: So I thought.  Them: And if you talk to, like, a seed stage fund that has a couple hundred portfolio companies, like, they need to manage their portfolio, right?  Me: Cor. Rect. So just so on, on the way, I'm thinking about the tech. Is that? You would need to. So, for example, someone like you. You would set up your existing portfolio first in there. And then there would be a learning process by which it will figure out what the parameters are of the sorts of things you like. Which will then create those filter views on the pipeline side. Right. So my thought process was that, you know, maybe in addition to some sort of hard coded, like, these are the sorts of check sizes we write, this is what we're looking, you know, and then it will pull stuff in. Like it will also look at your portfolio to help inform what the deal flow should look like. It's very much a plan, but yeah, maybe. So help me understand how you would triage your day to day on the pipeline side.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So. So I guess one last thing on the portfolio side is also keep in mind that, like, we have a whole system that we have to use for reporting lps. And that's where, like, it's super important to get the data right in terms of, like, rounds, ownership, revenue and metric, all that stuff. And I think there's been no good solution. That, like coordinates between the deal teams that are talking to the companies every day. And the back office kind of LP reporting system.  Me: Yeah, that's a good flag.  Them: And.  Me: And how do you. How. How do you, like, verify that it is accurate other than just you? You say like, we've checked this five times and, like, I really hope it is.  Them: We looked at every quarter. We have a kind of LP deck and we look at it. And there's a finance team that collects the data from companies and all that stuff, too. But I would say, like, the biggest pain point for us and for me is, like, on the New Deal side, right? Where it's like managing the pipeline, prioritizing the pipeline. And then being proactive around what companies you should spend the most time with. And it's all around, like, discovery of company companies, as well as, like, doing initial research on those companies to kind of triage and prioritize them. All the way to how do you kind of be proactive, Be proactive, preempt something, get the data to do that, and then also, how do you piss yourself to win? And so, like, some funds have the philosophy of, like, they ignore everything except for 10 companies, and their goal for the year is to just get in front of those 10 companies and invest as many of those 10 companies as possible. And that's really like. That's like a high touch. How do we plan a dinner for this company? Who are the people we know in our orbit that are relevant to this kind of product and could be customers that we can organize a dinner around? Like all these things that can kind of branch off across different priorities. But I think, like, the Holy Grail is like, structuring what a fun thesis is. And what. What a specific fund or investor thinks is important, exciting, interesting about the market. Using that to help them with discovery. And then using that with all the context of all the companies they've talked to and structuring all of our Granola notes and all that unstructured data in terms of, like, is there any insight that. Has been collected from all these conversations that either change our thesis or focus our thesis on specific companies or opportunities. Then what are those companies? And then how do we manage your network and both internal network within the firm? Like, this is what Oivind does really well, is it distracts people's email. So I know if someone had talked to a company, I know who's connected to what company. And so I'm kind of talking about an individual level. And then it's kind of on a firm level is a whole nother abstraction. And then, like, how does the firm's network. Kind of how can we leverage that and only does this? Well, in terms of like, who are the most relevant people. We can make intros to specific companies because we've. We know we have a relationship with them. It's a good relationship. We know we can make a good kind of warm intro, and we know that person's relevant for this company. I think that's like, if it was just like, one feature, I would love a tool that when I talk to a company and I say I'm going to make some interest to customers, it goes into our network database and says, these are the five people you should introduce to. Here's the email to send to them.  Me: It's Burton's most requested feature.  Them: Yeah, exactly. And so, like, do is I, like, right now, when I have all my, like, meetings with kind of prospective investments, and end of the week, I just ask Granola, like, what are my follow ups? What intro doc promise? Because in my head, I'll be like, oh, I can introduce you to these people. And actually, be able to go follow up on that is the most important thing. And that's what you kind of have that kind of pre proactive thing because.  Me: Too. Ava, can you help me understand? You know, you said, like, you know, some. Some. Some firms will do, you know, they'll just have 10 targets, and that's what they breathe for the whole year. Surely both of us would say that the best way to run a pipe, you should be run like a sales pipeline, right? Like, you know, you should have, you know, an end goal of amount deployed or whatever. You should have kind of a weighted rating on whether that's likely or, you know, should have plans A, B and C.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Me: Surely right. I fail to see how that first approach is smart.  Them: Well, yes, but with the sales pipeline, like, anyone who fits in your ICP is a customer that you want to go after, right? And it's like, pretty clear, it's pretty well defined on who those targets are. With a venture pipeline, you actually don't know if it's an interesting company until you have the conversation with it, so it actually starts much wider.  Me: Yeah, that's interesting.  Them: And you have the same issue of like, how do you get in contact and how do you go win the deal and how do you manage middle of the funnel and everything. But it is less clear on what the core target is until you, you actually have those companies and do the work and then that core target, it changes. Over time.  Me: Do the work. Yeah.  Them: Right, because you may. You may have a thesis in AI for compliance. There's actually only one company that matters. So it doesn't. Like, you can do all this work around that space, but it's only focus on one company. You can't build a pipeline of 30 companies that like, if you can't get that top customer or investment, you go to number two, number three, number four. So you get much less leverage out of the pipeline than you would as, like, a sales team.  Me: Right. Yeah. That makes sense. That's interesting. I mean, again, that just tells me that the 10 company approach is done because there's still a lot of risk there. But I hear you. I mean, that 10 is. The basis of hundred.  Them: People think that the argument against that model is, like, if you don't win any of those 10 deals, or none of those 10 deals are actually interesting, like, you didn't do anything for the year.  Me: Screwed. Yeah, exactly.  Them: So you kind of need a combination.  Me: I've got a run, man. I'm getting pinged. I got a next one. I really appreciate you.  Them: Oh, go. Well, let's talk more about this. Like, I'm have. Like, I love talking about this stuff, and we think about it a lot. And I have a lot of views on, like, what the ideal products would be for us to sync all this data.  Me: Y. Eah. Maybe we can catch up. Maybe we can carry on tomorrow if you have some time.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm actually proud. Is it pretty easy? Just text me whenever. Ping me whenever you are free, okay?  Me: I'll ping. All right, man. I appreciate it.  Them: Awesome.  Me: Peace.
