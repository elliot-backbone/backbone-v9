 Them: Monday. I'm struggling today. I wanted to ask you a couple questions and just kind of get your thoughts, because I see this dynamic because I work dummy with a bunch of people, and they don't see this interaction with her and other people. And I kind of wanted to ask you one question first. I think this is my observation, sort of watching the interactions. I think sometimes because. Your was such a shitty partner, to be very frank. And I think he would do things like, well, we know how to do all these things. And to be very frank, in that world, With him. He had no experience. Nor did I, in sort of the space you've been in. Which is like, how do you build a proper gtm? I wonder how much of that lens. You've applied in our interactions. With this new thing. And I'm just curious what your thoughts are on that.  Me: Yeah. What do you mean, more specifically?  Them: Well. I mean, look, I don't need some feedback on some things, but things of like. Well, tell me your plan. Tell me this. Tell me how you're doing this. And she's coming from a space where she's done this for numerous startups and for large companies. And I think. I wonder how much of it you're worried that we haven't done the basics.  Me: Yeah, I sensed this, too. It's interesting you say that. It's interesting point you make. So how I view that in response? I view Dominique as being very defensive, or rather perceiving that to be the case. So, for example, I'll give you a concrete example. On the last call. I remember we were talking about the design partnerships that you've got. Between the three of them, Stripe and Netflix and Sofi. And I asked the question, know, do we have a process in place that's driving it through to some sort of what are we doing in the design partnership, basically, right? What is structure? And the reason I ask these questions is not because I have an interest in checking whether it's being done, although of course I need to know if it's not being done because I would say it should be done, but because it was specifically in reference to the prior question, which was around what do we need? To come out to market with in terms of fundraising, what kind of meat on the bones, what kind of KPIs, what kind of metrics, what kind of story do we need to tell? And of course, that's directly impacted by, well, what are we driving these stripes and Netflix?  Them: Yeah.  Me: Through. So instead of I wanted her to say yes, overall, what I wanted us to get to as a discussion of. Okay, great. So now I have that understanding. But it sounds as if the sort of metric we should hang our hat on is whatever it is, right? Like count of lines of code corrected.  Them: Yeah. I don't think there's anything. Let me try to put away. I think there's a little bit of. You're trying to understand how to best position this. I totally get the intention.  Me: Correct.  Them: And there's two parts. There's two conversations going on in simultaneous, in parallel. Right, that I think you said. She's going. Hey, why do I need to use Backbone? Right. She doesn't have the luxury. Like, I spent a bunch of time with you and really understanding your process and understanding what you guys bring to the table. She doesn't have that experience.  Me: Yeah.  Them: She's going. Hey, why do I need to give these guys such a big chunk of the company? We know all these people, we can go have this conversation. I've been part of driving all these relationships in the past.  Me: Y.  Them: So there's a question for her on. Let me try to phrase it. She's like, I'm getting naked, showing you everything, and I haven't heard anything from you guys on what you're going to do that's going to uniquely position us. That's really her position.  Me: Ep. Yeah, yeah.  Them: I gave her some feedback on a better articulate that. I was like, hey. You could have paused the conversation and been. Hey, we've shared a lot. How about you tell us this set of things? Instead, she feels like she's like, I told that and I wasn't listened to multiple times.  Me: Yeah.  Them: And that's why I asked you this question about how much is anchoring off of the past experience where.  Me: Yeah. No, not. Not at all. I mean, as I say, it's more like, you know, how on earth could I just. If you step back a second, like, how on earth could you expect me to have an opinion that is. That is in any way useful if I've only talked to you? Yeah. If I've. Only talked to you twice in the last six months or what, you know, whatever it is, right? Like our normal cadence and normal rhythm is, is. Is. Is much tighter such that I know this stuff. And on another vector, I would say that, you know, that there's a degree of trust and, you know, we are about to. Go and bat for you. And if we don't know exactly what's going on,  Them: Yes. Without understanding the details. Yes. Yeah. I'm trying to give you the other perspective, which is she's like, why is this guy telling me how to do what I know I've been doing for 30 years?  Me: Correct. Yeah, but it's not. It's not. You know, I think it's great that she's there doing that stuff now, but unless I know, you know, I've got to know. It's basically just discovery.  Them: I know. Yeah, like I'm trying to give you her perspective so you can understand. It feels like her perspective.  Me: No, no.  Them: Is like Elliot not listening to me. I don't know what the value.  Me: I understand the perspective. I mean, you know, it's. It's. I've discussed it. You know, I understand the perspective and how I view it. Exactly as I said at the start. Like, I think that she interprets it as me being, you know, checking the work or whatever.  Them: Yeah.  Me: When, when, in fact, it's, you know, when you go to the doctor and you ask, you know, the doctor has to ask you what you know. He has to diagnose the problem, doesn't he? He doesn't, you know, he has to talk to him. He can't just.  Them: Yeah.  Me: You know?  Them: My feedback is there's no point in stopping the conversation. I think the real ass underneath the covers is. He's asking why? What? And I try to give this. And this is where I don't think she's never seen the spreadsheets that you guys have. She's never seen haters. You know, there's 70 different VCS that we're going to work with. And I was giving her the plot. Like, I think the memo is a better approach. For instance, than doing a deck. Because they use that memo to ferret out, like if there's interest. And then basically it's a way of filtering instead of you going and having a one off talk with 70 people. But the act of someone actually reading a document tells you their interest. If it's a deck, people scan through decks all the time and then pass. And they often face their opinions on very little information. There's a bar to entry. And this is what I'm assuming. I made a bunch of guesses, but I assume because.  Me: You're exactly right.  Them: People actually have to spend the time to read it. So if you get a package sounds really interesting, it means they read the document, they looked at it enough. And it's like, okay, now it's time for us to engage and actually work with the right people to see if there's a deeper interest. The point I would mind. She hasn't seen any of that, so she's gonna wall. And my point to her is like, look, we're not. Gonna spend. The amount of time. Look, there's 50 VCs I can ping, right? I can pee them all day. But that's like the amount of work we're gonna do to go through that group vet those people. Find the right person. It's just non trivial. And on top of it, defocusing effort for us. I tried to level center. I think my advice feedback to you is like, hey, I think unintentionally, a little bit of her pushing for that view. Into what the unique value add. An example I told her was like, hey, If we raised by ourselves, we'll raise the money. Okay? We've already raised a bunch of money. Without a lot of effort. But the difference is these guys are going to help us get a multiple we couldn't get on our own. They're going to get us to the right dc. Who's going to help us? Down the road and. She doesn't have that same experiential understanding. And so my advice is almost to help her. So that's what she was trying to ask you for.  Me: Yeah. What we have to do. Exactly.  Them: Help me understand why working with you. Will be an accelerant. Right. Does that make sense?  Me: And I think that's it. We need to switch it. As I say, I think there's some defensiveness, some territorial stuff there, but I think we need to, you know, we are an enabler. Right? Like, like, like, like it should be, like, exciting as a sort of like, well, here's all this stuff. That they can do that just I would like to do, but I just couldn't be here because I just don't have the time.  Them: Man. I'll work on that. Yeah.  Me: And so, you know. Yes. On the fundraising side, it's like, between the two of you, I don't think you have the time to manage, you know, 30 to 50 ongoing, you know, relationships or conversation.  Them: You're repeating exactly what I told her.  Me: You know? So. So, yeah, we don't need to, you know, between us, I think we're in line. But the other thing is, it's just, you know, I'm reluctant to start to go and down a sort of, you know. Transactional, kind of like, you know, here's what we will do for you sort of thing. Because of course, you know, you understand that. So it's a thin line. But the other component to it is obviously, I know that.  Them: Yeah.  Me: You know, you guys are both, you know, founders and, you know, sort of democratically, but I think ordinarily speaking, or indeed, you know, all the time,  Them: Some of my decision.  Me: Well, we, you know, we would be working with you primarily. If your intention is not to be the one in front of the investor, then we should talk about that too. Because you know that that would be unusual. If it isn't, you. But. So if it is you, then, then, then you know.  Them: No 100%. This is not your room. Her intention is not for her to go meet with all these vcs with me. Right. She just wants. The thing which she's talking about is there's an aspect.  Me: Right.  Them: Of. Here's the things that she cares about. She wants to make sure that we don't. And I kind of said to them she doesn't want to take so much solution. She doesn't want to just cash. And then put us in a bad spot where we feel like, hey, we have no control of the company. These guys are telling us what to do. I think the deeper concerns or the same concerns I think you've parroted back to me in the past? But there's this worry about, like, hey, are we going to pick the right investors? Are they in the right market? Are they right people? And from, if you think about it from a COO perspective, He's thinking, hey, I'm going to be making these forecasts. I don't want to end up in the situation where.  Me: For sure.  Them: We've picked an investor who doesn't give a shit about us, and we're in a bad spot. So she has some dimensions of what she cares about. But they're not like the, oh, I want to meet with these guys. I need to be in front of all these people. I need to have these conversations. That's not where she's coming from, if that makes sense.  Me: It might be helpful. You know, maybe we should just connect to with a couple of CEOs in the portfolio and just have her, like, talk to them as well. You know, as a way of saying, like, you know, don't. Don't listen to me. I mean, it doesn't seem like much I could say would. Would help anyway, but why don't you just listen to two of the C3CEOs talk about what we've done, you know?  Them: I think the thing that. And I gave her some thoughts. It's. I use a lot of poker analogies. And I was like, there's some things that you say and I watch her go on tilt. Do you know what the poker term? Piltines.  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I like that. I like poker. Yeah.  Them: She goes on tilt, and it's usually something you say that's sort of critical of her sales process and. The reaction is like, hey, I know what I'm doing here. It's like, if you came in and criticized my architecture of my design,  Me: Correct.  Them: I had someone do this. Actually, we know these guys. A friend of a friend introduced us to this investment bank, and I actually didn't want to, but they're one of our SPV investors. Sat down and talked to them, and they had Mark McDonald there, who's. He wrote this book called Writing Solid code. It's like 30 years old. And I know him. He started saying this whole thing about, well, if you're going to hire a bunch of people once you get money, you can't just hire an instant. And you got to. It takes time to build an organ. I was like, dude, I've been building teams for fucking 30 years. 1000. Persons esteemed. I could have easily been like, who the fuck are you? What have you done? You've written a bunch of books, but you haven't built a fucking team in 20 years. But my reaction wasn't that. My reaction wasn't like, let me show you all my emotions about my disdain for your comment.  Me: Yeah.  Them: What do you mean by that? Help me understand your thinking. And this is how I am actually thinking about it. And I gave her that example. I was like, yes. I could have easily been like, fuck you, man. I know what I'm doing. But there's a couple comments that I've watched you make where she put on total tilt, and I'm like, look, never show your emotions.  Me: Y. Eah.  Them: You have to always be an active decision. I gave her these feedback points, but there's just these comments that set her off that I'm like, what the heck? Relax.  Me: I think. I think. Yeah. It's strange because I don't have enough insight into a process to have a. You know, I don't know. I see, I see the reaction from her, but again, I view it as defensive in nature because it's not a comment on. On anything in particular, because I don't really care. I'M not close enough to it to know. But I agree.  Them: Her general high level. Thing is, I haven't seen enough from these guys.  Me: Yeah, yeah, I know. I get you.  Them: And this guy's questioning. My confidence and capability. I'm rephrasing what she said.  Me: Y. Ep. Yeah, I get you.  Them: And so that's why I was like, her app is like, hey, show me. The value prop, right? Because the flip side is like, hey, we're going to do a sizable chunk of the company, you guys. What does that get us? In the conversation last week. The thing noted is that. This may not have been your intent, but the reaction was a very high level hand. Wavy, sort of like, yeah, we do this and this and this.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Very tangible look. We're an accelerant. We're going to help you raise it. A multiple that you guys, you might be able to do, but the odds of doing it with us just going to be way higher.  Me: Y. Eah.  Them: What I've been trying to get her to understand is there's a higher likelihood of us raising at a higher multiple.  Me: Because.  Them: Because you guys will surface us to the key VCs that are really critical in the space. And that's why I think she was asking for this. Show me these TVCs, the relationships. The thing is, I've lived it with you, so it's like I have this lived experience.  Me: To the. Key.  Them: That's very hard to impart. The person. Does that make sense?  Me: Part. Yeah, well, this is what we're going through now, exactly. Trying to figure out how to do it. Yes, I. I hear you. I hear you. So I've got this. I've got this list. You know, I pinged it to you. I'll refine that today.  Them: By the way. I know I'm the CEO. I know I can do the. We're just going to do what I fucking want because I own way more of the company. But I always hate doing that because it means it leads to lots of weird.  Me: Yeah. Yeah. No, she was right when she said, like, I wouldn't, you know, she's like, I. I would want to be as enthusiastic about this as. As. As Jared is or you. You know, like, I agree with. I also would. Wouldn't be interested in, you know, in, in. In starting something off on the wrong way at all. I just felt like she's being very critical.  Them: Seems to be very critical, but she's also like. Let me put like. She was like, hey, we went through a 30 minute meeting and 18 minutes in, and we were just talking about what we're doing. And.  Me: Well, yeah. Yeah.  Them: So she's like.  Me: I hear.  Them: Did she get the pitch? The pitch that I'm. Look, I took to heart a lot of things I saw you guys do with these investors back channeling. The whole experience was like, hey, I'm going to get feedback I won't get from these guys because they'll tell me everything's wonderful to my face and then tell me shit on the back. End, which is the stuff I need to hear.  Me: Cor. Rect.  Them: And the other thing I want to kind of imparting me is no matter what, I've always valued your people who are willing to tell me things that I need to hear, not I want to hear. And so that's the part that I think it could be very awesome. And I also think you clued into the whole knowledge graph, by the way, which is something Dominica I've been talking about for about three weeks.  Me: That's. The part.  Them: That's a critical asset for us.  Me: Yeah.  Them: And the fact that. And I also explained why GitHub is not doing it, why Microsoft's not doing it. And when you tell people that they're like, what? What do you mean they're not doing that? I'm like, nope, they got no plans.  Me: I know it's.  Them: And I have inside knowledge.  Me: Yeah.  Them: And that's crazy.  Me: Yeah. So. So hang on. So. So let's just wrap. On the Dominique topic. What I'm going to do is, as I say, I've got the list. I'm going to refine that today. I'll share it with you. You can give it a quick once over on that initial list. You know, per our discussion about, you know, fintech investors, because again, you know, Dominique expressed that, that concern that we might be sort of over concentrated there. You and I discussed that very briefly and you said maybe you had some ideas on that. You know, do you think that.  Them: I sent her the opposite, which I think you suggested, too. And I already made this point to her before you sent it to me, which was. You know, the fact that they know people as Sofi allows us to get the customer side of things open, too. It's not just the VC side. Right? The fact that you can bring us. Help us bring customers. But I think.  Me: Stripe or so far or whatever. So okay. So that's yeah. Go on. Okay. Yep. Yes. He he and I also he and I also talked and and and he basically gave me the guidance that I've sort of given back to you, which is one, you know, she doesn't respond well to sort of comp you know, it it will turn into a sort of potentially confrontational energy quicker than it might a constructive one. And so the better way to do it  Them: Mhmm.  Me: to say, like, you know, look. Sound sounds like you you you got it. Right? Like,  Them: Yes.  Me: here's what other here's some of the risks that I might see. Right? And and and these are some of the things we might look out for, but, you know, seems like it's it seems like you've got it. Right?  Them: Yeah.  Me: And then kind of let it percolate a bit slower.  Them: I I think if you one of those things where the the first relationship that she interacts with you and there's a positive loop? Everything will be fine.  Me: Right.  Them: Right? It's like I I don't mean it doesn't have to be as successful. It's just, like, once there's an insight that we didn't see that you're able to share, the whole dynamic will change in my mind. And it's interesting.  Me: Exactly.  Them: So that's where I was like, hey. Think Jason's advice is spot on. It's like instead of criticizing the current go to market plan, I mean, if you have criticisms, you can filter them through me too.  Me: Yes. I I don't. You know, I I I  Them: So that I can I know?  Me: you know, I I don't I don't know enough to to to have just yet.  Them: Yeah. But but I'll push her to just like, like I said, like, what's the harm in going through this? Like, I was  Me: Right.  Them: like but there was, like, an emotional on tilt reaction to the  Me: Correct.  Them: like like and it's like, who cares? Like and I gave her some examples from the some of the engineers that are working for me now. Like, do you see me going through this with these people when it's like, like, usually, I know better than them, but, like, I don't don't project that energy. Right? You know, it's like, me explain. Let me share my thinking. Let me get through it. So I'll work with her on that.  Me: Yeah.  Them: I do think there's, like, definitely a space of, like,  Me: There's, like, definitely a space to  Them: we really I mean, my mind, I think that the more I've been working on this, the more I think this could be huge. And I think us positioning ourselves as investors over the next three to four months is probably critical because we are probably gonna need a lot more money than I thought we were gonna need.  Me: I think so too. You know, I I I you know, I think our point of view is that know, this is one that you you go go pretty big on or go home. You know?  Them: Yeah.  Me: And and to me, that looks like, you know, a big VC story.  Them: Yeah.  Me: So, yeah, we're we're we're on the same page, and I and I appreciate the the the useful know, like, how do we actually how do we get into the middle a bit better with with everybody? Right? So I appreciate it. And, like, you you know, you can always you know, know, I eat what I cook in the sense of, like, I I'd much rather  Them: Yeah.  Me: also appreciate the the straight feedback backwards. Right? So  Them: No. I'm straight up with you. I mean, the other thing I would just  Me: Yeah.  Them: give you a lens to think about is that this is by no means, like, you should change as a human being. But you gotta remember women in tech  Me: Yeah.  Them: are always getting this. Let me hey, honey. This is not you saying this, but this is like, hey, honey. Let me tell you how to do sales. Honey. Let me tell you how to do this. And I've been growing a lot of females in tech, they're they're, like, incredibly attuned to that energy.  Me: Yeah.  Them: And there's, like, an overreaction sometimes to it. So, like, like, I don't see her react to Matt that way, and I don't see her react to Jason. There's something you're saying that's triggering her  Me: Right.  Them: and I'm going, what the fuck? Like, who like, like, my reaction on on the it's like it's like, you didn't have to be that harsh. It was like, you stopped the conversation versus, like, inviting the conversation. And I was like so I gave her all the feedback, by the way, just so you know. And, like, she was very receptive to it. Right? But it's just like there's something you're saying that has that  Me: Yeah.  Them: like let me tell you how to do sales, honey. Right? And and  Me: I'll listen back to the I'll listen back to it.  Them: yeah. I looking for our recording, and I don't have a recording of it. So I was like, what the fuck?  Me: I I I I only have a I think I only have a like, a what's it called? Granola, which isn't the full thing.  Them: Yeah. So  Me: Okay.  Them: were both looking for it because I was like, I'm pretty sure he didn't say that, but, like, she was like, I was like but I noticed this. There's there's it's always a question of, like, coming down to, like, questioning for a plan. Right? Right? And it's like it's like, you know, I'm the officer I'm like I'm like, hey. Any feedback you have is good feedback. Right?  Me: Primarily in the first instance it's purely to  Them: Yeah.  Me: Like, it's not even not even to have an opinion on it. It's just so I can know to to answer the question. Right? It's complicated, this stuff. You know? It's it's not you know, unfortunately, well with fundraising is you know, it's hard to put things in boxes all the time that are neat, and and it's hard to  Them: Jack Horse?  Me: draw a straight line through to you know? And and and and some people's personality types prefer things to be, you know, in boxes and and and and stuff. So, anyway, I I I hear As as I say, the action from my side out of this is gonna I've got that list. I I'll finalize it. I'll share it with you first. You can just give it a once over, and then I guess we'll figure out on text how to you know, like, should I have a session with her or, like, whatever? I know. I'll let you talk to  Them: Yeah.  Me: Jason and stuff first.  Them: I figured I would get Jason's input because he knows her pretty well.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Their interactions, and there's a lot of mutual respect there. And it it comes down to trust in Mandarin. It's not a  Me: Exactly.  Them: like, it's not a there's, like, a a breakdown of trust, and I'm like, okay. What  Me: Yeah. Just like I don't know him. Why is he saying this stuff?  Them: yeah. Yeah.  Me: Yeah.  Them: And so it's like and I even would say there's a world in which I had a question for you. What is Matt doing? I saw he changed his LinkedIn profile He's a founder and something else too. Is he not  Me: Yeah. No. No. That's we've all done that. So so we put our Backbone enter  Them: no longer  Me: on LinkedIn. Last week for the first time ever. You know, we we released the you know, brand, if you like, because we're we're gonna be raising money ourselves this year.  Them: Mhmm.  Me: You know, and and so as you know, it requires us to have a public presence really. So this is the first sort of the operation of that.  Them: Gotcha.  Me: And and it's just strategically, we've there's four of us in in the company now, know, you can see them on the profiles. We we've all got that stealth startup thing in our profile purely because we know that the VCCRM scrape that stuff. So we just want it to be visible in the VC CRMs. Like, we're not  Them: Okay.  Me: you know, that that we're not you know, that that we're we're all full time backbone, like, you know, we we actually had a planning meeting two weeks ago for the year, which Jason joined. So you can him about it too. And, you know, we've got we've been modeling out, like, you know, 12 partners by the 2027, like, you know, there's there's real big plans happening on our side now. But so so still fully around. He just hasn't  Them: Yeah. Yeah. We we I think she's  Me: you know  Them: I mean, like, for for a better she's her respect for Matt is pretty high based on his background. And so that was the other thing I was gonna ask you. So would it make sense for  Me: Yeah.  Them: Matt maybe to engage with her a little bit and give her perspective?  Me: Yeah. Yeah. For sure.  Them: I think, like, it it also paints a bigger pick up more holistic picture of Backbone versus  Me: Definitely.  Them: Elliot. Elliot. Elliot. And, you know, if if if she's got doubts there, it will contrast that  Me: Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Happy to.  Them: Does that make sense, Ben? And I don't mean that in, like, a negative way. I'm just trying to give you, like,  Me: To Whatever whatever gets the thing the thing done. I mean, it would normally you know, we're because because we don't have a contract with you guys, Right? We we we had to ration out the  Them: Yeah.  Me: engagement  Them: The work. Yeah. I get it.  Me: bit more. Right? But but but it it under normal circumstances, once signed, like, would expect, the team to really be me and Matt and Jason. Right?  Them: Yeah.  Me: With the other two guys we have in the background, they may or may not be necessary. But you know, how that would manifest is like, as I say, like a a weekly call with with both of us. We, you know, we're in the weeds, you know, blah blah blah. So, yeah, that's that's more just a function of  Them: Yeah. No worries. I just let me let me chat with Jason.  Me: resource allocation.  Them: See what he thinks the best way to kind of, like it's it's really about, like, I got the the chance to work with you guys closely, so I have, like, I have very little doubt Right? It's just about getting her to that which was exactly what she getting her to be that excited about the upside.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Right? And so that's where, you know,  Me: Exactly.  Them: I think it might be helpful for Jason and me to sort of brainstorm you know, what the best approach is. So  Me: Yeah.  Them: to kinda get everyone on board. And I and I wanna tell you, like,  Me: Yeah.  Them: I think she's come off really poorly with you, but she's not like that at all. That's what's weird. Like, it's like  Me: But those people those people are often some of the best you know, like like, you know, you would want that person working for you, wouldn't you, really?  Them: Yeah. Yeah.  Me: You know? In some way. You don't you don't want someone that just jumps on a call and and says, you know, everything's great and and signs everything with no with no thought. Right? Like, some of the best revenue people I've worked with are actually very, very tough people. Right?  Them: Yeah. She's  Me: Yeah. Exactly.  Them: she's looking out for me is what I would tell you. She's, like, very much, like, why should we give these guys anything for something we can do  Me: Exactly.  Them: And and I haven't seen this. And I think I'll work it, man. Don't worry don't worry about that. Anything else that's on top of my screen, man?  Me: So I guess two quick well, one major. So so per the topic about the the, you know, the the Git kind of repo stuff, like, you know, my yeah. My idea was on the market intelligence side, sort of like you know, as I've been vibe coding, I've and then, you know, it's required me to put stuff in repos and things, and it needs them all to be public repos in order for  Them: Mhmm.  Me: me to connect the front end tool. I mean, know, surely there's a window there where know for example, my Backbone repo was was public and, like, let's say we were what, number one VC in the world, like, the number two VC in the world would probably be interested to see what that build was, right, for no other reason than just to monitor  Them: Good.  Me: And so, yeah, I was just you know, as a sort of sales intelligence tool, like, where that would fit or whether it's a different company altogether. You know?  Them: Yeah. So there's two things we've been thinking about. One, we thought about, can we sell the scores we're producing right now to VCs? So, like because instance, we can scan repos public and private. And, like, when you go to a VC, they have no idea how good your shit is.  Me: Okay. Right.  Them: Right? And we actually are giving people, like, of it like, almost like a due diligence thing. In fact, know, when we talk to these one of these design partners, we're them sort of data that they would spend a week figuring with senior engineer. I also thought we could sell that to VCs potentially. As, hey. You're you're looking to onboard this.  Me: Yep.  Them: Here's the score on Otter. Right? Which I think is an interesting business. But the other thing is that we can  Me: Yep.  Them: we also thought maybe and this is something we're trying with is we're gonna set our thing up to scan all the public repos. In GitHub and GitLab into bucket. And I thought about doing I'm doing a bunch of sold social media to drive people to our product. We're also thinking about doing, like, a regular, like, video podcast. Basically highlights the top people in the industry. Based on our scores and shares what their best practice is because it's sort of like, you wanna be like, these people come to our site, and we'll do it for you. Right? So it's sort of like we're trying to do a couple different things in that space. But  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Or you could take the worst score and and and work with them for a bit and get it better.  Them: well, that's we we go after them. So  Me: Yeah. Right.  Them: do the podcast on who the best are, and then you you go to the people who suck and and you basically  Me: Alright.  Them: say, hey. We see you got all these problems. Wouldn't you like to be, one of these people? Like, we you know, Facebook's React. You don't wanna spend the resources to do it, but we can do it for you for a thousand bucks a month. Or something like that. Right? That's that's  Me: So my my idea of on on the repo thing was more like maybe I'll give a different example. So, like, Stripe. Right? Like, you you you your Stripe and you obviously have, you know, 10 to 20 companies that you monitor that are strategic competitive to you, all the other payments companies, you know, crypto, whatever. Right?  Them: Mhmm.  Me: Every time someone from one of those companies upload something into a repo that you can get access to, you provide analysis back to Stripe saying what it is. Like, you know, market intelligence on what that company is built  Them: Yep.  Me: and whether it's, you know, on the road map and and or, you know,  Them: I got you.  Me: should you worry about it? Is it a partner opportunity? You know, that kind of stuff.  Them: Interesting. I mean, definitely something we could do. And that's why I think that's why it's shocking to me that GitHub has not done this.  Me: Well, it's insane to me that the the the data sort of  Them: Right?  Me: security on it is is so, like well, rather rich You know, my understanding of having skipped through the API and not being able to read one, really, is that it's quite rich in terms of the data it exposes. Right? Like, in terms of what you can pull from it. And so yeah, my thought was, as I say, like, if I'm if I'm Stripe, my main competitor is Adyen, let's say. Right?  Them: Mhmm.  Me: You know, there's a team of 30 to 50 product people in ADN and, you know, they're all gonna be being forced currently to to to use AI to do sort of the front half of engineering work that may have been done by an in the past. You know, they're gonna be vibe cody a little bit. And so, you know, you would imagine that there's a lot of stuff going up there into repo.  Them: Oh, interesting.  Me: It's just like internal testing, you know, like prototyping, like  Them: Subscription service. Yeah. Yeah. So there's a  Me: you know, and yeah.  Them: there's, like, a there's a there's a video podcast that called GitHub Awesome. Which basically highlights the most like, last week's cool repos that got published and what the cool things in them were.  Me: Okay.  Them: Right? So what and it's interesting. Someone's made a whole business. Out of having a website basically, a blog where they just  Me: Right.  Them: highlight new repos with new features that came in this week.  Me: Right. So it's like that, but filtered for your competitors.  Them: But, like, for a business, like, you're it's almost like a subscription service.  Me: Yes. Yes.  Them: We really worry about these companies. Tell us what they've done. Tell us what their open source moment is.  Me: Correct. And so you get an email every morning saying,  Them: Interesting.  Me: here here are all the push and the pulls and the commits and the change. Like, you can monitor it as it goes along. Basically. And then from there you can make inferences like oh, shit. Like, this guy was spending thirty hours of this week on this product. Like, this must be a priority for them.  Them: Yeah. Interesting.  Me: Right? Yeah. That's  Them: You know, the other question I ask you to think about too and don't have an answer is, like, we got this feedback from these business people that were like, we should we should make the knowledge graph a separate asset and a separate company around it, and then license it back to Otter.  Me: Well, that's why know, exactly. I mean, that's so where I said originally, you know, on my on this idea, you know, that I just described, like, to me, that is a different company.  Them: Yeah. Yeah.  Me: Right? It's not it doesn't fit exactly with what you you you your where you're going, but the the data asset underneath it is is the same. And so you wonder then how many pairs of unique clothes could you put on that data asset outwards. Right? Like, how many  Them: Yeah.  Me: times could package it up and have it you know? And that market intelligence thing, I think it's super lightweight. Like, you literally just need to search for email domains of your competitors or whatever. Like, you know, monitor a plus or minus change thing and then create an email. That's all it needs to be.  Them: Yeah. No. It's it's very we're thinking about this a lot, and we were doing comparisons against Meta and what LinkedIn did. Because LinkedIn has reason Microsoft bought LinkedIn is because of the economic graph.  Me: Okay.  Them: And I've been trying to give people perils to, like, link being like, Microsoft's acquisition on LinkedIn was not because they had a social media site for finding jobs. It was because they had this internal graph of the economic activities in the entire knowledge or work  Me: Right. Right.  Them: force. Right? And they were all monetizing it. Right? And the other reason this is compelling is because given the current m and a approach that companies are taking, they actually are much rather purchase the assets of a company than the company as a whole.  Me: Mhmm.  Them: So, like, you know, you you create a bunch of structure that allows another company to acquire pieces of your company without it being  Me: Or license it.  Them: yeah. The same thing. Yeah. Exactly. So, like, that's why I we're we're thinking about it.  Me: Yeah. Exactly.  Them: You know, the question I have there were a lot of logistical questions about how to do it because, like, think, technically, I have to give everyone who's put money in the SPV  Me: Yeah. I think  Them: some portion of that new company you know,  Me: I think so. Yeah.  Them: So we have to think about how to do it.  Me: Or I've had a yeah. I mean, in the first instance, I I would make the make it that that that's a problem we have to deal with.  Them: Was Yeah.  Me: You know? Like like, you know, is there really something there? I I I I I you know, add that to to what you should talk to Stripe and and and and and SoFi and about. But but but from my point of view, I I Stripe would would be would because Stripe is also such an extremely acquisitive mode at the moment. It's buying you know, it has a lot of conviction on the corp dev side about strategic direction. Like, they're clearly doing a lot of work about, you know, the market and and and  Them: Yeah.  Me: you know, market intelligence will be a huge part of that. And something like your thing, is is is that idea is like, it's like, it's predictive. That's why it's, I think, is a value is that it's sort of like it's it's inferring. It it's you know, the they wouldn't they they can't get that information anywhere else. You know?  Them: It's interesting because they Scott McVicar, who is, like, the head of, I think, dev prod and a lot of the engineering tools. Yeah. But  Me: Yeah. You'll try there.  Them: I spoke to one of his reports, who knows me, and she was like, oh, I'll I'll I'll point him to you. And I thought, oh, yeah. He'll get back to me. He got back to me, like, in a day. It was like, as soon as she sent the email, he responded and said, hey. I'm out for two weeks, but we should totally chat about what you guys are doing.  Me: Nice.  Them: He told me I'm very interested. So I think there's a lot of interest there.  Me: Yep.  Them: It sounds like we're rubbing up against the whole class of problems they have. Both from a, like and this might be another thing to ask them about.  Me: Well,  Them: Like, hey. Is this something that's interesting for you too?  Me: correct. You know? And and don't muddy the water. You know? Keep them focused. But, like,  Them: Yeah.  Me: it they should know that there are that there's there's there's promise and interesting things that can be derived from stuff that already exists today as well. Right? It's not like  Them: Yeah. Yeah.  Me: know, it's not like sign this thing and then we'll build 10 more things hopefully. It's like, sign for this one thing. And by the way, this one thing could also fuel these three other things.  Them: Exactly. Yeah. No. I it's just  Me: You know?  Them: I'm just signaling the interest was surprisingly quick.  Me: Yeah.  Them: You know? Because sometimes someone says, yeah. I'll be interested, and then you don't get a email back for weeks.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Right? This was, like, instantaneous. It was, like, they  Me: Yeah.  Them: and I got a response the next day, and then, like, Let's get something on the books as soon as possible.  Me: Yeah.  Them: As soon as I'm back. Right? So I was like, oh, shit. Maybe they are.  Me: Well, as I said, they've been buying you know, they they bought  Them: And they also  Me: they spent a lot of money in recently on on new companies. Right? They just bought Metronome. Before that, they brought they brought Bridge. You know? The the they have, no doubt, another one or two to do this year. And so I just you know, there's there's a there's a there's a a a working corp dev, like, product development muscle there that that that would be willing to listen to stuff. Yes. Here's my point. So  Them: Yeah. There's there's a there's a bunch of other companies like this. Atlassian's in a similar boat where they're buying everything they can also in the same space just so they can be competitive. So this  Me: Yes. Yes.  Them: definitely a lot of upside. So  Me: Cool, man. So as I say, I'll put this list together but then I'll I'll I'll share it with you, and you can figure out you know, talk to Jason and figure out what we're gonna do.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Yeah, if we wanna connect back in with with with Dominique or as I say, to my mind, also, I'd be happy to put her in front of a couple of our CEOs. Typically, that's what we do anyway. We just get out the way and say, like, let them talk about what we've done.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. No. I I I think that's also helpful. That's why I was like, let me let me strategize with Jason a little bit and see what he thinks.  Me: Yep.  Them: Because he's he's had a pretty direct one on one with her about this. I think, previously back in December. So I'm curious  Me: Yep. Yeah. It was funny. He was like,  Them: like, his thoughts.  Me: was like, oh, man. Sorry about that. That sounds brutal. I was like, you know, it's what it is. Elite in sales, as I say, you you get used to these sorts of things. So anyway, I'll I'll let you go, man.  Them: Alright, man. Alright. Have a good day, man. Bye.  Me: I appreciate it. Bye.
