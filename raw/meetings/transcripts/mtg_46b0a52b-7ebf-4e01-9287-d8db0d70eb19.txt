 Them: Hello, mate.  Me: There he is.  Them: How. Are we?  Me: Good man. Okay. Nice to hear your voice. I thought I'd never hear from you again.  Them: These dulcet tones. I'm sure you don't miss them whatsoever.  Me: You're big time VC over at Primary. You got no time for the little guy anymore.  Them: If only that was the case. More. Holy shit. I've got a lot more to do.  Me: Yeah. How was Christmas? How was New Year? Where were you? Were you here? Are you there?  Them: I was here. It was good, man. It was really nice. Kind of parents came over. Sister came over to. Yeah, it was a really good time. New Year. Pretty chill, nothing too crazy. And then, yeah, she kind of got back going on Tuesday of last week, so kind of catching up with everything from a couple weeks off. How about you? How was your time?  Me: Same.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Without the sort of cute New York City Christmas overlay that you had probably. With everyone being. All. Having a christmas in new york. With the massive trees and did you go to. Did you go see the big tree and all that stuff?  Them: Y. Eah. I saw it because I needed to go to the Rockefeller center to pick something out for a present for. Fucking hell, mate. I don't know if you ever did that. It is fucking carnage. It's unbelievable.  Me: All right? Because right there. Yeah. No. I never did it, but I've done similar. Like, I've walked through it trying to get somewhere.  Them: Yeah. It was horrible. It was genuinely one of the worst things I've ever done. I was like, I'd never want to do this ever again.  Me: Well, I mean, I could have told you that. Yeah, no, same. Nothing. All good. And yeah. Similar getting back into it now. It was nice to have some time off, actually. I feel like people needed it. Everyone seemed. Know, Needed to just go switch off for a bit.  Them: Yeah.  Me: But, yeah, we're making moves this year, mate. I mean, it should have been our Friday, but we should be putting our LinkedIn, we should finally be releasing Backbone onto LinkedIn today, tomorrow.  Them: Awesome. Yeah. About bloody time. How bloody time?  Me: And then really what this is is working backwards. From. Your point of conviction that we finally got into around. We are going to try to race. We're going to raise some money this year. I'll stop putting caveats around it. We're going to try and do something this year. So working back from that,  Them: Yeah. Okay?  Me: It's very first baby steps towards manufacturing an LP presence online that sort of appeals. And some of what my CRM stuff that I've been doing is kind of lighthouse style vaporware in some ways may as well.  Them: Yeah.  Me: It's like a nice shift, momentum wise for us, just sort of culturally know. We're no longer kind of sort of floating around, trying to wait and see and figure it out. We actually have a plan of something or other now.  Them: Yeah. Yeah.  Me: There's the four of us, like Alex and Justin, continuing to get more integrated. Like, they started off kind of. Not full time as such, even though I think part of the reason we've been enjoying it so far. I don't know, any of us would say we're kind of full time to doing stuff, but we didn't have their 100% dedicated kind of mind share, whereas we're getting there. Now in terms of just the raw volume of work requiring it. So that's good. Jason Pay is more formally engaged now as well. He joined our planning meeting last week.  Them: Cool. Cool.  Me: And I have a bi weekly with him. I kind of manage him internally across the portfolio.  Them: Yeah.  Me: And then company, sort of portfolio wise. There's the core group of probably 10 or so that would be worth talking about. Majority of those now being true Backbone incubations, the handful of later ones like the Wayflies, et cetera. But I wouldn't put those in the 10.  Them: Y. Eah. Yeah.  Me: And out of that 10, I'd say. I can't think of one that's in shutdown mode. Let me put it that way. So starting from that perspective,  Them: Cool. That's always a good thing.  Me: Yeah, I don't have any of those. I've probably got one or. One or two that I might say are at risk. And I would put checker in that bucket, having just. Even though they've just done around. Yeah, we can talk about. And then the rest are green insofar as they've just done rounds with increased marks.  Them: Interesting. Yeah.  Me: And all good things, just growth, heads down, blah, blah, blah, the whole narrative for the rest of the year. There'll be fundraising this year, of course, but just sort of the narrative currently to the market is like, we don't need. We're just going to go and build for the next little bit.  Them: Okay?  Me: And then on the pipeline. It's pretty buoyant. I was just looking at it now because I just sent something. To someone and we've got. Yeah. Nine companies with various. Sort of arrangements. Engagements forecasted the vast majority of those. Now, I say that. Three or four of them are net new codes, and then the other three or four are sort of opportunistic things for various reasons. So I'd say out of that pipeline where, as I say, a healthy amount of cash forecasted. Some of these are more cash biased engagements than they are through equity plays. So we've got three or four coming, and I can talk about what ones they are. Actually, yeah, there's actually one missing from here, too.  Them: Yeah. Cool.  Me: And then, of course, as I said, sort of given the increasing capacity that we have with the team, and both Alex and Justin have brought in out of these, in this pipeline, there's companies belonging to them too. So they're kind of getting into the motion of it now and sort of bringing bounders to the table and stuff. So. Yeah, mate, all good things, really. And I mean just. I'll pause.  Them: That's awesome.  Me: Just back to the fundraising thing. It's like, now that we have this, we have a portfolio that I think is we can talk about and a body experience that we can talk about. And so the next 12 months will be up to us to figure out the flavor of that, whether it's kind of the regular. Asset management, sort of the 2 and 20, whether we want to be doing one off SPVs per deal, whether we want to be an embedded sleeve within a vc, whether we like, you know, who the fuck knows? But that's a nice sort of set of problems to have now, I think.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally.  Me: It's, you know, that's why I'm quite energized.  Them: Yeah, well, that was, I mean, first and foremost awesome, man. Like, congrats. Not surprised by any of this at all across the board, but obviously awesome to see you guys taking the next step, going public and moving towards, you know, the original intention of going to raising something. I mean, that was going to be. My question to you is like, what does that something look like? And you kind of half answered it there. But do you think it's going to be a fund? Do you think it's going to be an incubator? Accelerator, svb. Okay.  Me: I think we'll do one of. I think. I don't think that. For me, the reason that we're involved in the business is the equity value that we see long term.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Less so in the asset management model, I think of sort of managing a pool of capital.  Them: Okay?  Me: And it also comes back a little bit to who is the customer. Right. Because at some point there's going to be a tricky sort of line to tread there, where right now we're very firmly, very clearly working for the CEO, for the founders.  Them: Sure. There. Is.  Me: But at some point, the customer might become the investor, and then it's a little bit tricky, right? So there's a middle ground there. If you have to. Guns on my hand today. It would be kind of SPVs managed on a quasi kind of one off basis. The source of the capital behind that, though. Part of me wonders whether. It can be done. With a few. Like, I'd love. I'd love to be able to. Get a small group of just basically just super fucking rich guys. To pull together a couple of million each or whatever.  Them: Sure.  Me: To a certain amount and then run the SPV model. But I just think. My other route is to do what we would advise. Or really, I think smoothing this out. Like, the only route is to do what I would advise our CEOs to do, which is a flavor of what I just described, which is, you know, go and go and get a couple million from your angels stitched together, a bunch of 100k checks from your angels while in parallel talking with your institutional options. And then using the angel sort of indications to bolster up and give credibility to something on the institutional side, because we're getting to is that we would tell the CER CEOs like, you should raise more than less if you're going to be out there in the market. You only got a couple.  Them: Sound like a great bull death guy.  Me: But so therefore. But also, we've seen it. Like, I see it with Henry now. Like, I see it with. I see it with all these solo GPS having horrible times because they didn't raise enough.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Or rather they raised, weren't put a value judgment on it. They had an approach where they've now got stuck between a rock and a hard place. Where they've deployed too quickly or too chunkily or to whatever or into too long term things, they don't yet have the performance to go out and actually get the next thing. And so the last thing you want to be is an investor that can't invest.  Them: Yeah.  Me: And so we would say, I don't want to do a 25 million fund. I don't want to do a 50 million. It's got to be 50 plus.  Them: Yeah.  Me: And so then it's 25 and 75, probably like your POC into your big one. And so then you say, well, I may as well try and get 100.  Them: Yeah.  Me: So really, I think in my head is 100. That's a big boy amount of money.  Them: Yeah. It is. It is, yeah. And obviously takes you into a different sphere of LP that requires certain things.  Me: All that stuff.  Them: Which is a lot fucking work.  Me: All that stuff.  Them: I actually haven't spoken to Henry so much on the fundraise. Like, tell me, like, how. How is it going for him?  Me: Well, I just get the impression my data take it for what it is, about a bit stale. You're closer to Henry. You probably get different talk track on it. But my read, based on what he tells me, and he's very open, he always sends me info and numbers and stuff.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Is basically that. He can't move to the next level. He's been deploying out of his own pocket.  Them: Y. Eah.  Me: He now has run out of money or he can't continue to do that. And he's only got, you know, he's got these seven or eight deals or whatever it is. And now what does he do? As far as I know, he hasn't got any institutional like he hasn't yet put money to work that is not his.  Them: Y. Eah, that's true.  Me: And I don't think that he has any committed that he can point to. I still get the impression that he's out there. Sourcing stuff, pushing his current stuff along, and then doing the selling on the side. And like. We've heard this all the way up to. Like, do you know, like, stack that new thing, like the like 0.72 guy. You know, stack vc.  Them: I think I came across it. Yeah, it's one of the Point72 partners, right?  Me: Right. Pete. Pete Casella. And then I got the guy who ran Cap One Ventures and then some other guys that we know. But, like, just. Just to sort of go on the other end of this, like. Yeah, because Henry. And again, credit to him, like, he was like, look, I think some of the feedback that I get is. Just like, you know, you.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Me: You, you, you, you. You did a lot of deals at Finn, but it doesn't mean you're a good investor. I was like, yeah, you know, that makes sense. But nevertheless, Henry and you. But Henry was leading a team at a pretty. At a pretty prominent place and did a lot of deals, sort of stuff. But, you know, maybe on the higher end of the credibility spectrum, all the way to someone like Pete. Who did all this stuff already, like, at point 72, like, we were speaking with those guys for about 18 months, and, like, they still haven't really closed their fund yet, their institutional fund, like, all the. All that heavyweight. Heavyweight boxers involved, and they still can't push it over the line, so it's extremely hard. So weighing up all these things. Yes.  Them: Y.  Me: Because you know, I put rerail. There's Anthony in that bucket.  Them: Eah.  Me: There's Wish off is doing okay, I think, but she's got kind of a good sort of brand engine.  Them: Exactly. She's played that really well.  Me: Yeah, but, you know, by and large, Gideon Andrina never does a deal. I never haven't seen him invest in anything.  Them: Yeah. I mean, he's done. He's done probably like six or seven, but, like, four of them are just buddies from Monzo kind of vibe.  Me: Yeah, and that's also so.  Them: Which is good deals, I'm sure, but all it shows is you've got a really good network of Monzo people. But, you know, that's a pretty finite network.  Me: Right when that runs out. Yeah, exactly. It's like, okay, so you want me to give you 100 million to put network. Yeah, exactly.  Them: The back six deals from Monza. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm sure if you look at. I mean, I really like Gillian, but I have a feeling if you look at, like, size of those deals, it's probably like, you know, 50k checks, 100k checks. He's not. He's not even co leading any of those.  Me: And you know I got no interest in that sort of. Yeah, there was point of any of that. So you know that that's all the stuff we've got to figure out, right?  Them: Yeah. Yeah, I mean. I mean.  Me: What about you, anyway?  Them: Yeah, all good, mate.  Me: What's the remit? What are you working on? You know, when you make partner.  Them: So. Hopefully soon, but, yeah, basically, the remit from my side is everything. Financial services. And I definitely have a lot broader remit than I did at fin, which is very nice. Both in the way of, like, you know, subsector team, like, whatever those kind of vectors are. It's just a lot more like first principles basis of just like, is this a generational company? Yes or no? If yes. Let's look into it kind of mindset rather than like, oh, we're looking for a P founder, it needs to be in B2B fintech. It needs to sell this way to this person or whatever is a lot more first principles, which is nice. The second part of my remit is anything kind of enterprise software, kind of that's like bundled in alongside. I think it's a great way to do it, but obviously interesting for me to have to be able to do that and not just FinTech and SureTech world. And then the third part, which is a little bit different, is I'm actually doing everything go to market as well. So sales, tech, customer support, customer service. Implementations, you know, next generation CRM tools. Whatever it may be. That's kind of like my minor compared to the major of fintech and enterprise. But it's a nice, like, newer kind of segment for me, which has been fun. But, yeah, it's been good, man. The pace is definitely a lot, lot faster than it was at fin. There's a lot more throughput, a lot more deals. Kind of at least being looked at, not. Not getting done, but, like, you know, we are. It's very difficult for us to running it like.  Me: How does it. What's the head count? Different. Like how many people?  Them: So. So actually it's quite significant. So it's a rat. It's not too much more an aum. There are probably a couple hundred more than fin, but we've got 60 people full time. So it's a very different model, you know, Finn now, and we can definitely talk about fit at some point, but I think they had, like, 15 people now, like, completely different approach. This is very, like, we believe in platform. We believe in, like, the enduring advantage and, like, compounding that, like, a really solid platform brings. So there's 60 people. Only about 12, I think, are investing. And the rest is all business development, talent, hiring, corp, dev, you know, design and branding, like those kind of like key pillars.  Me: Wow. How did that.  Them: There's like 40, 50 people.  Me: And the history of the firm. Like, how did that. Because I don't know if you read. Do you read the like not boring Packy McCormick?  Them: Yeah. Every once in a while. Yeah, yeah.  Me: He did afford this to you? Because he did a thing the other day a couple days ago about a 16Z. It was really fucking good. I don't know if you read it.  Them: The interesting one. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I need to read it. Probably. I've only seen excerpts.  Me: But he talks in there a lot. About what is a firm, what is a fund, and what we know outside of just being different words. Like what make one and what makes the other. And it's interesting as we. As we as Backburn think about this stuff.  Them: Yeah.  Me: That sounds extremely expensive. Like, the model there. Like, you know, how does that get stood up? Like, did they raise on the prem? Like, you know, did they run it lean? And then once it was successful, they built out the operating teams underneath.  Them: It is. It is. Pretty much.  Me: Right.  Them: Pretty much, I think the classic in the early mid innings of like, what, oh, what is this thing called a platform, vc, et cetera. And I think they were one of the ones who are like, hey, we can. Well, basically their origin story was like, why is there no Andreessen Horowitz for New York?  Me: Yeah.  Them: And like, why does Sequoia not even have an office here? And they were just like, this makes no sense. And they were like, well, we can't compete in the Bay Area and win against these huge platforms when Andrews has, you know, probably at the time, 100 people or whatever. But where we can win is. Like New York. So let's just like, basically kind of replicate the strategy, but just focus everything on East Coast New York and just ignore the Bay Area. So that's basically, like, the origin story there. And I think from the platform perspective, yeah, you know, they just, like, I think they started deferring correctly with hiring, and they were just like, let's just like, find an amazing vp, talent leader, chief people, officer to come in and just, like, basically just be like, we're the best place to find talent in the New York area. And, you know, created a bunch of different, like, talent initiatives to just capture as many great people as possible in, like, events and the network fellowships and things they did.  Me: Across the portfolio or just to become a hire. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah.  Them: Exactly. Yeah. In order to just be like, hey, we know every great person in New York. If you want to hire great people, which if you're a great founder, you'd obviously want to do, then you know, where the gateway to New York talent, basically. So I think they started that route.  Me: Y. Eah. Yeah. And then.  Them: I think they did. And then business development was second. And the way they do that. And I think what makes us quite different, actually, and I've really got a sense of this now, is like. It's not like the fin model where you have, like a staff and you just ping her and she finds half an hour with you, she gives you some advice and she's like, you know, go for it. Here's a couple of intros or whatever. Here. The way they do it is they do, like, half of that. Half of that is just like, hey, advisory. And whenever you need us, we're here. The other half, though, is what they call, like, embedding. And that is, like, quite literally, where we basically sell at cost, our staff to our portfolio.  Me: Okay? Interesting.  Them: So. So that'll be like. So if a founder's just raised. Then you might be like, hey, we want to hire I know, head of engineering, you know, two engineers, you know, one full stack, one like, you know, back end dev or whatever. And then we want to hire an SDR and something else like a customer success manager. You know, a lot of people be like, now we need to spend my time as a founder for the next six months hiring and putting these people through. Or I need to go, like, hire a recruiter and do that. Or I need to, you know, find three or four different firms. Good. Or different parts of the stack and then pay these recruitment fees. What we'll do is we'll be like, hey, we have six people on the recruitment team. We will embed one of our recruiters into your company for six months until this is done.  Me: Do you do that?  Them: And you just pay. You just pay the cost. Yeah, we do. So exactly what we do on the BD side now as well.  Me: No, but. It's so, like, someone could be like, I want like a, you know, first person on the ground in New York. For such and such a thing. Can you go and be the GM for that thing for three months?  Them: Probably. I think that would probably be a little bit too senior. I think the town that they found, because obviously, like, Primary, want to make sure that they're not paying some guy, like, 600K or whatever. To, like, you know, be those kinds of things where primaries done really well is like hiring, like, you know, people that are maybe three years into their sales career. Who want to get a bit more. They maybe don't know what, what vertical they really want to double down in, or what precise part of, like, the rev ops, sales ops kind of world do they want to be in? So they'll bring in its Primary and then you just get, like, the ability. To try three or four different portfolio companies, really get a sense of what stage and what sector you like, etc. So I'd say a lot of these people are probably more like 25, 26 years old, and they're probably like, they're basically just really, really good SDRs that start to come into, like, the AE kind of, you know, experience, set and role. And basically, yeah, we'll just be like, you know, if a company is like, hey, we really need to ramp up our, you know, pipeline. We're a little short on, like, getting to end of year. They'll literally just be like, hey, can Ryan join the team for three months, and we'll just pay his salary.  Me: That's a cool model for salespeople. It'd be quite fun. I've just sent you my favorite junior, 25 something head of SDR, currently on the market person. I would highly vouch for Jack. I would love to be able to get him in the loop in the process.  Them: Yeah. Cool. Yeah, we're actually hiring three people right now for that team.  Me: Okay?  Them: So potentially could make sense to chat with him.  Me: Yeah, I was trying to get him. So I. I've been trying to move him into between us. I was trying to get him as the chief of staff at Pluto for Neil. Neil is making the wrong decision between us, and he wants a profile that is not right. But that's a separate thing. But just to show like. Like Jack. Jack's ready to take the next step. Let me put it that way.  Them: Cool. Co. Ol?  Me: So I would love to be able to. Yeah, I can get you a CV or whatever. I don't know how that works.  Them: Yeah, CV would be awesome. And then I'll just send it straight over to Jason Galman, who runs that whole team, and he's hiring three people right now.  Me: Okay. Sweet. Yeah. Okay, great. I'll do that when I get off the call. That's really interesting. And then I guess. How does that work? So do you. Do you think then that inevitably what happened was kind of. As they grew up and the LP has changed. They were able to kind of. Match the performance expectation. With sort of the investment in people like, you know, with a higher fund, do the earlier fund, higher returns. And then as they kind of grew and smoothed out, like that was when they realized pension. Now, like, we can, we can, we can bring the expectations lower, we can have more.  Them: Yeah. Pretty much. Yeah. Very much. Pretty much. And yeah, the fund size at the beginning, I think that first three funds were like pretty similarish size. And definitely of the mindset of 150 million to invest in New York. Pre Seed Seed is like more than enough. And anything more than that is just going to be like a dragon return. Make us make terrible decisions or make us drift into a series AMD stage that we're actually not well built for. And, like, no one really has a lot of, like, true experience in of, like, how to do that really, really well. And then you probably also just frankly, like, come more and more into the world of competing against the big platforms at that stage, because then they are doing stuff in New York. Obviously. So, I mean, that. That was a big part of the mindset. And I think from my understanding, it's probably about a year and a half, it kind of switched where I think they suddenly realized, firstly, we can definitely go more than New York. Like, we're not, you know, limited to this anymore. I think, in part because of the team size. And we're like, we can actually compete and win against other people now. And then the second piece, I think, was. I didn't even realize that the C category has, like, absolutely exploded in the last, like, 10 years. And that actually like deploying 100 million in seed. Is fucking nothing. Compared.  Me: Deal now.  Them: Yeah, pretty much. And, you know, like, there are tens of billions deployed at this kind of stage nowadays. So having 100 million of it is, like, you know, you're competing, you know, a 1% level. And if you look at Andreessen raising 15 billion, that's what, 18% of all venture dollars raised over the last year or something. That's fucking insane. Like, that's a real fucking bet on the future. And like, hey, I'm sure they're betting as well. They don't anticipate being 18% of funding next year or the year after. They know that this market is just increasing, right? And like that. Number in 10 years, time is probably going to look pretty fucking average.  Me: Y. Eah.  Them: So I think where the mindset shift of the Primary folk kind of really changed was like, holy shit, we could actually go raise 500 million in seed and it wouldn't be ridiculous.  Me: And you're 60 people now distributed across what is. So it's East coast, west coast, is there Europe?  Them: It's basically just new york.  Me: Okay?  Them: They have like one or two people in the bay, but they're kind of like part time venture partner operations type people. The big question is basically whether we commit to the bay and if we want to just really fucking go and compete there. And I think the answer is yes. I think you just kind of have to be in order to just deploy into the best things. And to answer that question for LPs of great new York, New York's really fucking solid. There's an argument you could go into Europe and you could do quite well there, but at the end of the day, the biggest and the best outcomes are still pretty consolidated in the fucking Bay Area. So if you're not playing the game there, then you are kind of choosing just to be kind of tier two.  Me: All. Right. Yeah. Agreed. Yeah. You'll always be the guys that. In. In on the west coast for some reason.  Them: Yeah, for some LPs, that's probably a good thing. But, yeah, if you're going to Cleveland Clinic, if you're going to Harvard and stuff, they're like, how are you going to fucking win deals that actually do real shit and go from 0 to 10 billion in a matter of two years? Or something.  Me: Just to shift gates, just forgive slightly. But what tooling do you guys have? And what do you think? So this CRM thing that I've kicked about, right?  Them: Yeah.  Me: You know, classic story of just, you know, we. We don't have any internal tooling that mashes what we need, you know?  Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.  Me: I finally realized that AI is useful and started using it in my own life, you know, recently and extremely addicted to vibe coding. And, you know, have stood up or continue to work on standing up a prototype that, you know, my end goal with it is that I can convince the team that it needs to be productized into something that we use at the very least, just because we need, we need it. And then, of course, the question is, is there a Is there an Equity story and an actual company there for other things?  Them: I love it. Yeah. Yeah.  Me: You know why I had to build it. Why I believe I have to cobble this thing together is just because I don't see anything out there that does. What? What I want, which, to be clear, is, you know, I'm envisaging the problem set here being one of a partner, or, you know, soon to be part, someone out of ec. Probably with a bias toward early stage, just because of how I've sort of constructed this thing. But, you know, someone at a VC who manages a pipeline of their own deal flow, you know, wants to kind of see what Wilder folks are up to and, you know, see the aggregate stuff.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Work those deals through a process or not. You know, so a regular sort of salesforcey type, sort of almost sales pipeline combined with, you know, the portfolio management side of it as well. Right. So like, you know, parallel view into, you know, the health and statuses of the portfolio.  Them: Y. Eah.  Me: Really with the North Star sort of thing of just like. What are the five? When I wake up in the morning, tell me what the five highest impact tasks I could do, actions I could take today.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Respect to that whole universe, but, you know, could be. And just the final thing I say is.  Them: Yeah.  Me: What I am working on now is evolving it from. Reactive. I. E. Like, okay, based on the last master data set I loaded and all the. All the scoring and shit I've built, and here's what you should do based on what I know. But then it should really be. Like. Well, yeah, but what are the five things also that I haven't even considered yet that I could do? That would unlock a bunch of stuff. So into the proactive. Not like call the CEO to find the board meeting notes, but instead it's like write a one page memo for the CEO on that product idea you talked about yesterday.  Them: Sure.  Me: Somehow it's figured out that that's a high impact. Like, whatever data can figure that out. And so that I don't, you know, affinity pulls in a bunch of stuff and sort of does some stuff. I think it's horrible product. I think it's really ugly.  Them: Like that. Yeah, it should. It.  Me: Salesforce doesn't do it? I don't know. How do you guys do it?  Them: 's both at Fin and at Primary has basically been. People have tried to figure something out. It gets over engineered, it becomes too complex or. Just people don't really use it, or people just, like, end up scheduling a ton of meetings right around these things, and then it just becomes, like, too much work for everyone. And everyone's like, this is a waste of my time kind of situation. So I think.  Me: Right. So, like, Fin, it was lighthouse. What is it? A Primary.  Them: Yes. Like the Finn Linehouse stuff, for instance. Like, I don't remember exactly how it went, but, like, basically it ended up in a situation where everyone was like, There's so many dashboards, copies of things everywhere. Fuck all of it. It doesn't really. It doesn't really mean anything. Yeah, it doesn't mean anything. So, like, we literally went back to, like, 50 editions and say we literally had an Excel spreadsheet.  Me: Way too much work. I remember using.  Them: That had every single company on it. In the portfolio, and we would meet weekly, and it would literally just be like they would have, like, you know, company name fund that it's in. Like a priority, like high, medium, low, whatever it is. And then it would have literally, like, key update. Yeah, it would literally a key update. And if someone put a key update in that field,  Me: Notes. Yeah. Yeah.  Them: Then that means it would be discussed in that meeting, and we would just go from, like, row one to row.  Me: Yeah. Y. Eah.  Them: It actually works quite well because you'd only put it if there was an actual key update. So we wouldn't actually go through every company anymore. So you maybe address 25 companies or something in that week.  Me: Yeah.  Them: And that was it.  Me: That's how we do it. Now.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. And honestly, like, annoyingly, it kind of works. And it kind of works quite well. But.  Me: Except being proactive, right? That's where it breaks.  Them: Exactly. So that's exactly what I was about to say. I think it works on, like. It works from, like, visibility point of view of, like, oh, cool, that company was discussed. Was anything actually done about it.  Me: Well, also, like you shouldn't just.  Them: And it's more of a reporting.  Me: You shouldn't ignore the others because there's nothing to talk about there. Like, it's a portfolio, so it's a balance. There's relationships, dynamics that are existing. Like, just. Just because there was no issue. Like, he. There could be two intros that you could have made that don't get. Discussed.  Them: Yeah. 100%. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It's exactly that. It's. It's the urgent hair on fire shit gets addressed. And in part, that's honestly, I think, to protect your own back. Just to be like, if this company goes to shit, I want it to be very clear that for six months I brought this up and. The part the partner's fucking knew about it and they didn't do it and they didn't do anything. So it's not my fault kind of situation. I think that was like. And then obviously there were real conversations that happen in those that were. That were very helpful and good and useful. But, like, our problem at Finn was fundamentally, I think, quite different to the problem we have at Primary, which is the problem at Fin is that we had 130 portfolio companies. Thank you, Henry. And, you know, we had, like, you know, at one point I was managing 46 of them.  Me: Yeah.  Them: So, like, I was like, I'm dying here. Like, I just need to just know, have a. I just need everyone to know what the fuck's going on.  Me: Y. Eah. Oh, yeah. You were. Firefighter. You were fire.  Them: Yeah, I was. I was literally firefighting. I was like, I need to sell play to. I need to, you know, try and save this company. I need to raise on that company. And I was just. I was pretty reactive, to be honest. And if a company was like, I'm doing fine, I'd be like, cool. Like I'm not going to prioritize you, but obviously, fine. It's not great.  Me: Fight. Ing.  Them: But anyway, so that. That was Finn. We went back to, like, pure simplicity of, like, just an Excel spreadsheet. Primary. The way there is a little bit different. I think they definitely went through the journey of, you know, I think every month they would do, like, a portfolio review. And of course, it just got fucking completely out of hand because they have about 70 active portfolio companies now across, like, five funds. So they were just. So I apparently. Like, six 12 months ago, that was like, this is not working. Like, this is now becoming a reporting thing and not a mic driving thing. And I think that's.  Me: A four day off site.  Them: Like, yeah, like the other one when he texted me the other day, you know, we now do it quarterly or by monthly, I think, but it was four hours, it was 10 till 2 and I just, we just sat there going through like 7ish percent of the companies in, in fair bit of depth, and that's. I think. I think they've come to conclusion you can't really do much better than that. Annoyingly, like, you do just want everyone in the room. Yeah, you want everyone in the room, you want all the partners there, you want all the information in front of you, and you want to have, like, a serious, productive. Conversation on shit.  Me: Yeah. Got to get. The information that goes into that. Is the massive variable there, isn't it?  Them: So that is. I don't know. I can obviously, like, screenshot it and send it to you, and I'll do that if it's helpful. But basically what you do is there's, like, a profile for every company. You know, you grade them, like red, green, orange kind of situation. And then in the meeting only, like. The greens and the oranges. Sorry, the greens and reds get talked about. And the oranges, I think, kind of like just left in the middle. And then I kind of like neutral status companies. But then we kind of write essentially like, any material changes in the last quarter, what are the key risks? Third piece is what we call glass balls. So those are like, things that basically, like, resash. The company cannot drop, otherwise this is not going to go well. And then I think the last thing is, like, Mick driving activities. So, like, what are we doing or could be doing as a team? Whether it's talent investment, team, gtm, you know, design. And branding, whatever it is that's actually, like, driving Moick on this, like, specific investment. So that's, like, broadly the way that they think about it. And I do think that it's a pretty decent framework, and I thought it aligned relatively closely to some of the stuff you had kind of picked out.  Me: Yeah, that high multiple. Like, that's an interesting maybe I should think about that as an input into my I have an impact value, which is trying to figure out how impactful the action is, and I should probably tie that to some kind of. Revenue or sort of multiple impact. It's interesting, but your model, I mean. That. How do the oranges ever change? Like there's no. There's no exit criteria. Like it doesn't again, Right? Like, you want a system that would tell you how do we graduate each one, Right? From a red to a orange, from an orange to a green, from a green to an exit, whatever it. Is.  Them: Yeah. Y. Eah. Y.  Me: And then. And then based on, you know, the relative sort of impact and importance of each of those things.  Them: Eah.  Me: Like, you know, give me a rough, you know. And again, I can see how it gets over engineered a million percent, right? Like, you know. But at the end of the day, I think I would rather have because AI is so useful now as well it can only summarized and made easily consumable like I would read or. Listen to a 15 minute, you know, podcast version every morning of my top 30 priorities for the week.  Them: Y. Eah.  Me: Refresh.  Them: Y.  Me: You know, like. Like it does. You can give people a lot of info in a way that is not a burden, I think.  Them: Eah.  Me: Right. I think that's.  Them: Yeah, I agree. I agree. I mean, a lot of what you're saying resonates with all the stuff we've been doing on Go to Market Team, right? Which is like these CRMs. And you picked Affinity, but you could pick literally any of the others. Are, like, just fucking inadequate. Like, they don't actually do anything. Or they are is just logging historical events.  Me: Right? The whole, you know, this is what post AI CRM is going to be operating system, isn't it? It's not. You know, crna is dead, right?  Them: Yeah. Yeah, but like, what I. What would be so cool if you built. And I. And I know this is not exactly what you're looking for, but, like, we would definitely adopt a VC specific CRM tool that had, like, it was basically like assio. Affinity, whatever you want, but like, had, let's say, meeting transcription. Tool that basically just, like, listened for, like, key risks, material changes.  Me: It's on the model.  Them: And then also. Yeah, exactly. And then just also listened out for, like, key next steps.  Me: Yeah, yeah.  Them: And then would automatically put that into some kind of platform, be like, hey, these are the three things you discussed.  Me: So I'm wiring up. I'm wiring up for a. No lip. I'm wiring up Granola currently. And I'm wiring up G suite currently. So, like, the ambition is very soon. Yeah.  Them: And, like, these are the deadlines. Go.  Me: Exactly as you say, like, obviously that the interaction gets tracked, but then, and, and you can, you know, single click into the audio and all that. But that it. That it. That it produces. An analysis on top of that. That is, you know, sentiment. But then, but then also next steps, right? And I have one of my. One of the major inputs into the company health on my side is how they're tracking against their goals. So you that is one of the sort of the one rare types of user inputted data that static that you have to kind of just put in yourself measure is the goal tracking.  Them: Yeah.  Me: But then the idea is, is that the next steps that get pulled out can be tied back to the goals tab, right? Or the goals track window. So you, you allocate a next step that gets you closer to a goal, and then it will de risk the company, it will reevaluate the company health again. Because you've put some stuff in towards the goal, right?  Them: Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a really good idea. I mean, at the moment, the way that it's done, right, is that basically, people like me on the team go through the board decks. That we have, you know, from potentially six, eight weeks ago, and we're basically like, yeah, like, sounds like we're on plan. Like, I'm going to put it in green.  Me: Yeah, yeah. Exactly. Exactly. And I mean, that's how the green, orange, red is very common. Like QED does that, too. Fintech Collective does that, too. But I think my argument is more just that the. Yeah. Like technology could now allow us. Yeah. We could have a thousand data inputs into each of those. Now, of course, maybe there's only four that actually should be in there.  Them: Yeah.  Me: But I don't believe that you the over engineering. I think it's been over engineered because it hasn't been done right.  Them: No, I think you're right. And I think, you know, obviously the, the difficult, the more technical challenge I assume has been, like there is a lot of unstructured data inputs that like, weren't really able to be captured properly without it being super manual. Because obviously VCS are, you know, their whatsapping. Their founders.  Me: Exactly.  Them: They're getting, you know, slack messages if they have, like, an external chat.  Me: Y. Eah. I've got to WhatsApp mcp built with claude.  Them: Exactly.  Me: Channel.  Them: But I think Granola is obviously like the big like that probably is like 80% of the context you need, because a lot of people are just on, on Zoom and on Google Meet, et cetera. So if you have that, I guess you probably 80% of the way there. And then if you have a tool that can just like, you can just, you know, dump in board decks and things like that and extract key information. Like, that's probably like 15% of the rest, and then you've just got 5% less.  Me: I heard from a lot of people. Henry as well. I talked to Henry about this because we were talking about Lighthouse a bit.  Them: Yeah.  Me: And Matt, a bunch of people have told me the first sort of lazy objection that I get back from evil that I haven't read the documents is like, well, you're just never going to get portfolio companies to give you the data. It's always such a bitch to get the data.  Them: Fuck that. You don't need. You don't need to ask them to do anything anymore.  Me: Well, that's exact. So one, it's been I've tried to, I've anticipated that to try to make it such that a lot of the stuff that inferred the signals as not reliant on some sort of hardcore inputs, but with the goals thing as an exception. But exactly. We have a weekly call with the CEOs of all the companies, right? Like, all we need to say is, like, how's the MRR looking for this? Like, and.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. You just need to ask the right questions.  Me: Yeah. 2.3.  Them: And the tool can tell you what those questions are.  Me: And then it auto populate that and say it'll suggest to you. Yeah, exactly. It will say, I've suggested amending this data because of what Aidan said in the last call. Do you agree? And you just go, yes. You know?  Them: Yeah, yeah. Honestly, I think it's great. Would you, out of curiosity, would you actually genuinely sell this to vcs or.  Me: I have no idea.  Them: Do you kind of, like, give it away to them?  Me: Yeah.  Them: And, yeah, I don't know.  Me: Who knows, man? I mean, those are. Those are all. Those are all great. Who knows? I have no idea.  Them: Yeah.  Me: My dog's just getting back from daycare. Just give me one second.  Them: It's all good.  Me: I'll be back in, like, 45 seconds.  Them: Okay?
