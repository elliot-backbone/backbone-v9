 Me: Controller.  Them: Referenced. That is a go to market channel. Kind of reiterating the one mini go to market strategy. But yeah, it was like two or three paragraphs, wasn't much there. And there's a handful of people that replied and have been pretty active, like viewing it and things like that. So, yeah, we did that. Just before Christmas.  Me: Hi, buddy.  Them: Okay? What's up? Man.  Me: How's it going?  Them: Good.  Me: What are you guys talking.  Them: Just catching up on go to market in the investor update.  Me: About? Cool. Yeah. What's the schedule like for next week? We need to get you some meetings, don't we?  Them: Yeah, I mean, there's those ones that I've just changed my phone, so WhatsApp chat histories have been a bit patchy, but I've been scheduled. Anything with the investors yet? And there's a handful of customer chats that I have scheduled. But basically, I think on the investor, if there's customer. I'm speaking to Jack today. Elliot, thank you for that intro. So I'll speak to him.  Me: Nice.  Them: This afternoon and see if we should meet next week. But, yeah, I guess on the investor side, and I thought about this. And I think, Elliot, we just discussed briefly that having a high degree of confidence that it would be build positive momentum with the portfolio company if they investor introduced us to them. But actually thinking that we shouldn't expect every single founder that we get an introduction to to be a good fit for our icp. So I think I should probably be a little bit less hesitant, basically, to ask for intros from the investors that are close. So I was thinking, yeah, Jack Buki and Themis. And a couple others. I was just trying to look and see if I had the list that I sent you guys, but basically, yeah, I think this week would be good to ping them and say update. And probably send them examples of portfolio companies that. That we'd like to speak to and just. Yeah, take it from there. And then I guess, like, the thing, Matt, what we discussed with Elliot was like, if someone comes back and then says, oh, I don't see value in this, is that a negative signal for us? Basically. But I think the more I thought about it, it's. I think the way that we, we position it as this is a learning exercise and this is what we learned from speaking to your portfolio. Company probably builds more trust than expecting that every intro is going to convert to a customer.  Me: Yeah.  Them: I don't know what you think about for sure. For sure. And, and in general, too, like, you know, if they introduce you to a portfolio company, you quickly find out that they're not your icp. You can also potentially be helpful to them without them being a customer. Right? You can say like, hey, yeah, you know, keep doing the quickbook stuff, you know, that sounds like you have a good setup and ready. You know, if I was you, I would start thinking about bringing in, you know, a fractional CFO or a provider at this milestone or something. You know, just trying to be helpful to the portfolio companies. But yes, you don't have to convert every single one. You just have to be helpful so that if they ever, you know, back channel and talk, they're like, oh, yeah, I loved my chat with Ryan. He was super helpful, you know? Yeah. Like, yeah, it doesn't make sense now, but, like, we're going to stay in. Touch, or he pointed me in the right direction, or he introduced me to somebody who might be able to be helpful. You know, it's just. It's. Think of it as like the networking game is creating trust. Right. And so the investors look for that signal of, like, you know, is adding you to their portfolio, building their network stronger. Right at the end of the day, Yeah, okay. Cool. Yeah. So that I think that's probably the main objective for this week, then, is identify the two or three people that. I'd like to have intros from. Ping them, see if they. Are open to a chat this week if they've got, you know, space in their. In their calendar. If not, I'll meet them in New York and then, yeah, just schedule the conversations with their portfolio founders on the back of that ideal.  Me: Ryan. I was just on with Nick from primary who used to be at Finn. Nick Daly.  Them: Oh, yes.  Me: He had to run at the end of the call. But he explicitly asked how you're specifically asked about how you're getting on. And I gave him the update, and he was like, I. We should continue talking. There's a reason I asked and he had to run. So I think I'm just going to loop you in with him on WhatsApp, and you should meet him next week as well, in New York. Primary is basically right. Like the East Coast Day 16Z I'll make sure first. Makes sense to. But I will also.  Them: This is without you. Without you prompting Elliot, or are you just being nice? And did you prompt him? Hey, you should talk to Ryan.  Me: No, no, no, no. Because I actually forgot. Like, I forgot that you got. Because he's English, too. I forgot that he was in New York. You're in New York, and. No, he brought it up.  Them: Yeah. Okay?  Me: And I will instruct him that we're on the hunt for, you know, customer intros, so he'll definitely be able to set you up with a couple meetings for next week as well.  Them: Yeah. Okay. And that just piqued my memory. It was. It was David, because he's. Yeah. He's also just.  Me: Yes, tao palal.  Them: Been super. Yeah, yeah. And then jake at torch. Buki and Themis. I think Sonny inside is just a good one. To have a cop with. I don't know if I'll necessarily ask him for, like, portfolio intros, but I think is a kind of light touch one. And the other one that came in pre Christmas that's been pretty active is Sorensen. It was a pretty junior guy.  Me: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I can tap the main guy there whenever we want.  Them: But yeah.  Me: But he's not in new york. They're out in. He's out in salt lake, I think.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. And I think this guy might even been on, like, Boston or something, but. And I'd also probably just put him a bit lower priority and, yeah, let him just track the updates for a bit because I. Yeah, I haven't had multiple touch points with them. But yeah, those are the three or four that I'll ping this week and just have an initial chat. Hopefully this week, and then see if there's someone in New York from their portfolio I can meet next week.  Me: Who else you know?  Them: Well, I was just thinking. Have you talked to Neil at Pluto or Mitchell at Lava or Jack Mitchell? I'm going to be in Mitchell's office a couple days next week. He just offered it and. Yeah, I don't know if you saw. There's been some back and forth with. With Mitchell, Matt, about, like, using each other's platform, and I. We're gonna. We're gonna hammer through. That next week. So I think with Neil, I didn't appreciate. Neil is he likes building and running and operating his old ledgers. So I don't think Neil's necessarily a good. He's been a good, like, thought partner and good, like Challenger, I guess, in terms of, like, where the value actually is. But I don't know. Yeah. Didn't just take him out to coffee. Yeah. And maybe even just say, like, because he did offer intros, so I'll just. Yeah, I could just treat him as I do with the. The investors and see if there's anyone I think I should speak to. Yeah. I mean, he knows a lot of very, very early stage businesses in New York. Right. Which is good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Me: Are you going to reach out to David Ryan?  Them: I think the only. The only one where. The ones we just mentioned. I mean, I could even ping Nick, too. Unless there's something explicit that you were hoping to catch up with him first. Elliot. But all those people.  Me: Well. I guess because. Because I didn't hear exactly what his train of thought was. I want to make sure it was something positive before. But.  Them: Oh. I mean, I think David. Yeah. Like, he's. Like, he wanted to put a small angel check in, I think.  Me: Yeah. No, David, you should do.  Them: Yeah.  Me: You do, david.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. So I'll do david, jake, buki, sonny. Neil.  Me: And Jack you're talking to today as well, right?  Them: This week. And Jack. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I left that one out because there's something already scheduled this week, so. Yeah, yeah.  Me: Yeah. Y. Eah. Okay? Anyone else you think of, Burton?  Them: Well on. On the investor side or the client side?  Me: Either.  Them: Yeah, Let me think. On the. On the client side. But on investors. Like Six4Five Ventures would probably be good. Maybe learn. Six, four, five. Was. What's his name? William Hess. Or he might somebody else, but. Yeah, yeah, yeah. William is the one that I spoke to, I think. We're a bit early, but that's a good one, potentially, to speak to. Who's the second one, Matt, that you mentioned? Lear hippo. Yes.  Me: Yeah, they'd be net new.  Them: I haven't spoken to them. Yeah, and I think I'll probably. Prioritize getting something sorted out with Mitchell first, because I think having it through Mitchell, when he's happy as a customer, paying. Will be the strongest path to them. Yeah, I'm just. Again, if you think that Mitchell is likely to convert, then I don't think it hurts, you know, for you.  Me: You don't have to wait.  Them: I. I would have the conversation, you know.  Me: But Mitchell could interview you for sure.  Them: Correct. Yeah, yeah.  Me: What about, like, extend Matt as a customer? Is that too big?  Them: I mean, that's what I was just going through my LinkedIn and looking through, and there's quite a few bigger companies. I just worry.  Me: Yeah.  Them: That. That. That's not enough to build momentum. Quickly. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that maybe I'm going to dump a couple CEOs in. In our chat real quick just so that we can review it. Yeah. I think, for bandwidth sake, like, we've got the guy. What's it called? Dura Software. Sloan, he's a controller there. I think he's like the big chief accounting officer now, but they're. They're Kicking off now, Q1, basically. I'm going to talk to him here in the next couple weeks. To test. New ledgers, basically, and I think with him, plus the controller that we have in the uk, like, that's already a lot for that level of statistication. So I think it's probably early stage founders where we take more reps in the next couple months, basically.  Me: Yeah.  Them: What about, like, bill ull ullman?  Me: I don't know. I was thinking about Bill. But how does that work? We want, like, customers. Really?  Them: For sure, but, like, I think he's. He always has a bunch of subscale startups that he knows.  Me: Yeah. Yeah.  Them: Yeah. I mean, I'm. I'm. I'm just throwing names out there at this point.  Me: No, no. I appreciate you.  Them: Or like you remember Jason Jones?  Me: Glenn Goldman, if you want to go down subscale.  Them: Yeah, or glenn coleman. Exactly. Those people. I'm just scanning my CEOs on LinkedIn and new york. Forgetting.  Me: I mean, really also, like. You should be. You should. You should buddy up with a bunch of the solo gps, Ryan.  Them: The solo gps for sure.  Me: Is nicole in new york?  Them: John Marcus is a good one. He has a brand new company. Pull up his. I'm actually speaking with him in a little while. Is that Nicole. Last name begins with a Elliot.  Me: Yeah. Nicole.  Them: I think she's moved to San Francisco.  Me: Now she's west coast. Yeah.  Them: Yeah. AM would be a good one. Who I just shared. He has a brand new business that he started that just got. Well, they bought a bit. Anyway, you can talk to him about it, but. But he's. He has a new roll up that he's doing in the ad tech space. And just closed on a transaction.  Me: What about, like, space back?  Them: Yeah. Casey actually called me the other day when I was. When I was on. On the phone. I can call him Beck.  Me: That's like a layup. Like, I know I don't know where Casey is these days, but.  Them: But he sold that business, so he's probably not in charge of the accounting anymore.  Me: That's true. I pray also doesn't give a. Fuck. That's annoying. Space pass. Too late.  Them: I mean. If. If the octane would be a good one. But again, this is like a much bigger.  Me: Jason. Gus.  Them: Business.  Me: I don't know. Let's not, you know, go to continue to noodle on it, but let's try and set some stuff up for Ryan.  Them: Yeah. And Matt, should we? Do you know what days you'll be there next week? Should we just pick a time now? Yeah, I'm typically in in town on Wednesday, if that works for you. Wednesday. Okay. Do you want to. Any. Anytime after, like, 10:30, and that should be good. Okay. And it doesn't matter necessarily where I think I'm around, like, flat iron, probably. That's where everyone is. That's where I'm, you know, Okay. Cool. I'll drop you a time then. Let me know if it's not doesn't work. Cool. Okay, cool. So I'll keep on working on on these as well. And then the only other thing, Ryan was just, you know. We went through sort of a review of sort of, you know, lessons learned on, on the Backbone side last year and just, you know, a bunch of pieces of sort of where do we want to grow the business? And something that's sort of a goal that we're going to be start starting to work towards is actually being able to, like, raise capital and invest in our portfolio companies at the later stage. As a way to sort of be able to build up sort of an asset management part of our business. So just wanted to put that on, on your radar. You know, for most of the portfolio companies, we're just trying to figure out, you know, at a certain valuation, can we have a warrant to basically buy up a couple percentage points of the business, you know, later on, so we don't have to have that conversation right now, but I just wanted to give you the heads up that we're trying to align interests as well on that side, you know, so.  Me: There's a link. Link to what? I said, Ryan. I was like, well, I wouldn't. You know, let's bring your contract up in line with General. You know, what we have elsewhere that was sort of linked to that. As FYI.  Them: Yeah. I mean. I kind of. I think Matt, both you guys, I think. I've brought it up. Like, when are you guys going to raise capital for for yourselves? So. Yeah, I think it's a natural extension. Yeah, let me know. Yeah, when there's something that I can. I can take a look at. But in terms of, like, you guys actually going and raising the fund, is this, like. Setting the foundation ideas that you do it second half of this year or something more imminent.  Me: Yeah. Well. Who knows? I mean, if you want to give us 100 million today, Ryan, we'll. We'll take it, but it's going to take a bit of time, I think.  Them: That was a little bit more coy about it, that he doesn't know if he wants to, you know, go through the raising the funds lifecycle all the time or jump straight into it after you guys have been doing this just, you know, for six or 12 months or so. But, yeah, I just wanted to know like, what's the. The timing or the specific trigger for you to go out and get the capital? Because I think you mentioned timing is critical. Yeah, so. So, I mean, I don't know if you saw, but Andreessen, you know, announced their. Their successful fundraise, right? They raised another 15 million bucks, you know, and if you. If you look at where the LP dollars are going, it's all concentrating into, like, a very small number of funds, right? Now. Yeah. And so it's very difficult, and we've seen it from the solo gps to raise blind pools of capital for emerging managers is what we would be considered. Right at the end of the day. And so our plan is not to go, like, push that boulder up a hill, right? Because I just think you. You know, we'd have to go. We'd have to spend a majority of our time, you know, just meeting with hundreds and hundreds of LPs, you know, to. Raise a relatively small fund from what what we are today now, I think things are going to change, you know, and like, my guess is the return profile of the guys who raised all that capital, the injury, sins and insights etc is going to be quite poor in this vintage because I just, I don't think it's possible for. For you to be. I mean, maybe one of them will. Will succeed, but I think, you know, I've seen that in the past where there's been a concentration of capital into a small number of hands, and that just tends to not do well in terms of returns. So anyway, the way that we're going to sort of work our way into it, you know, is by, you know, working with our early stage companies to, you know, set a valuation, right, let's say a 200 million dollar valuation, right. And we're all sort of aligned for us to get to a $200 million valuation. That's a Series B, you know, and at that point, you know, the business can stand on its own and sort of the risk and the right tail risk is sort of gone in the business. And then, you know, as part of that warrant, you know, can we get a small discount, you know, and we're at the moment negotiating with a bunch of the portfolio companies to figure out what is the right amount of discount on that. But, you know, my guess is it's going to fall in the sort of 15ish percent, 20% discount range. Which then allows us to be able to then raise SPVs around that, you know, if we were able to get up to that point. So, you know, but. And then hopefully, with that track record, We then can use that to basically be able to go raise a blind pool of capital at some point.  Me: Because I think a lot of. The differentiation. From an LP's perspective when thinking about, you know. Sort of who to give money to and how it should be deployed and. One. Can you get the allocation fundamentally the first time around, but then also, you know, can you continue to like in a world of declining overall volume of investable companies, which is its lowest points now, you know, there's much more money out there than there are places for it. A seat at the table is imperative. Right. And so being able to articulate as we go out to raise that, like, yeah, we really do. We've already got our seat at the table. Here it is. We believe then allows us to then structure the broader. Round around that, and then, as Matt says, then sort of parlay that over time into. Into something bigger.  Them: Yeah, okay. Okay? So I mean this in terms of, like, you guys actually putting cash into the portfolio companies. It could be like two or three rounds after you guys have started engaged with the company. Is that? Is that fair? And you guys purposely want to be writing the checks at kind of the growth stage rather than, I don't know, precede.  Me: I think to start. I think it's more of an it to me. You know, Burton have dealt sort of keep me honest. But there's more of an enablement strategy to be able to get back to the funding a net new code. I just think that the steps to get there. Today and the necessary ones to de risk it. First, with the intermediate approach.  Them: Yeah. I mean, it's. It's just being driven by the lps, right? So if we can tell the story.  Me: Yeah.  Them: That like, hey, we've been working with this company since both pre seed, you know, earlier on. Right. And so that gives us the right to compete. And the reason that we know this company entrusted and et cetera. And we can vouch for it, and we can vouch for the team and everything about it, Right? And what we're seeing is that $200 million round is when all of the investors want to come in. And so for us, it's easier for us to raise capital at that stage than going to LPs and saying, Hey. You know, I'm raising a 20 million dollar pre seed fund and I'm going to put 250k into each of these companies. Of scarcity and seed at the table. A lot easier when it's a company that's kind of already been stamped as a success. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, again, it's. It's. We don't want to be swimming against the tide, you know, if we can help it in the. Early days because we want to. We still want 95% of our efforts and time to be spending helping the portfolio company.  Me: Curated, ready to go.  Them: We don't want to all of a sudden spend the majority of our time fundraising, you know, for fundraising, you know. Sorry. Anyway, I got to jump. But it was good catching up and looking forward to seeing you next week, Ryan. Yeah, sounds good. Appreciate it. Bye.  Me: Ryan, do you. Do you need to run? Okay? You do.
