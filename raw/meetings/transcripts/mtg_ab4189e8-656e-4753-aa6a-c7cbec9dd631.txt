 Them: Flexibility on not being too constrained on initial check size. Or stage. It's really like just, let's just try to be in the best companies in the thesis areas that we like and being less strict on the stage side, at least on the fintech side. I think part of this is because I think the healthcare team, they have more of these growth, equity, PE opportunities, larger checks. And so we're going to probably be able to take more like, venture risk on the fintech side, but we're not going to do a ton of deals. Right. So it's like if we do an early stage deal, it's a company that we're still going to spend a lot of. Time with and try to get more money in. But the entry point can be a little bit earlier. We'll see how that manifests itself. Because it's like, inherently, let's say we build a bigger series. A portfolio. You kind of need a portfolio. Right? You can't make single. Right. Because it's the loss rates are higher. You can have the strategy, but then you got to take things to investment committee and get exactly have a strategy. But if the investment committee blocks all of the stuff, then that strategy doesn't matter. Exactly.  Me: Do you guys still have that sort of sleeve of more flexible capital? You still have that ability?  Them: Yeah. We do.  Me: Is that that's in the new fund as well?  Them: Yeah, that's in the new fund as well. Yeah.  Me: Roughly speaking, how big is that sort of special sleeve?  Them: It's about 10% of the fund, which is way more than we'll probably need.  Me: Okay, great.  Them: But it's really just like it's less around how big it is. We kind of told LPS it wouldn't be more than maybe 5%, which is 10% of the fintech side. But that's $100 million, right? So it's not really relevant. It's more like just a way to kind of do some of these smaller checks. And just simplify it from a plumbing perspective. But yeah. And Mabel, you're more. But I think Matt, your point is right. It all kind of comes down to when we demand it to go. Kind of find some of these earlier stage bets that are really kind of centered around market opportunity and team and custom tips, some of our thesis areas, but then how we approach them in our IC will be interesting too. Right? Because it's like you can inherently need to take some risk. Nothing's going to look perfect at that stage.  Me: You want to close out, Burton, by summarizing our ambitions for the year. We're going to start having our own kind of well going. Burton, why don't you. Talk.  Them: Well, yeah. So one change in strategy for us is in addition to sort of getting the founding shares as part of sort of helping work with the early stage companies, especially ones that we incubate like xfx, we basically realized that we should probably have a warrant to be able to buy up a couple percent of the business at a high threshold. So right now it looks like those are like in the 200 million-ish valuation ranges that everyone's so happy. Right? Because we're talking to a pre revenue hasn't raised any capital for us to say like, hey, we want ability to buy 3% of the business at 200 million at the founder's like, sure, I would love that outcome at the end of the day. And I think us being able to start to have this warrant portfolio that we can activate sort of allows us to then potentially be able to put SPVs together down the road for people who actually want to participate in it. That's a way for us to sort of diversify a little bit, sort of the funding on our side. I still think it's very difficult. For emerging founders, however you want to put it, to sort of raise new pools of capital. And so I don't think it makes sense for us to try to raise like a 20 million dollar seed fund just because we already have ownership that's around a seed fund anyway, without capital side way, it sort of allows us to have some ability to participate as the company scales. So it's like warrants that are exercisable once they hit, like, evaluation threshold. And then you go buy them, and you kind of raise a Stevie to go buy the warrants, Correct? Yeah. So it's like the first couple, it looks like it's like between a 10 and 20% discount above a 200 million dollar threshold. Yeah. And then like you kind of just got more exposure to some of the winners across the portfolio. Correct. It's basically our ability to double down on the stuff. Yeah, that's good. I like that concept. But yeah, as. As those. I mean, again, I don't think it's like, whole. Hopefully it's one later this year. We'll let you know, because I think we're relatively flexible, right? And, like, we might bring in VCS to take that component and et Storey on that side, you know, or. Or if that doesn't work out, we might have to go to, like, family offices, but it'll be, like, exposure to individual companies, right, that are the better performed ones in the portfolio. Yeah. Ones that we hope are easier to fundraise around. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it makes sense, right? It makes sense to, like, just get more exposure to that part of the portfolio. Right. As it matures and everything. Yeah. And we were looking through it today. I mean, portfolio is doing very well. You know, we have everyone grew last year. Everyone raised capital last year. You know, so it's like, you know, again, who knows? You know, this is an eight year game before you actually figure out if they're. But at least you know, what I would say is the market feels very different now than it has in the past. Most of the older fintechs. Are sort of either have failed or selling or have, et Storey you know, and so that that portfolio feels like it's winding down, you know, or consolidating into a handful of bets at the end of the day. And I think, like, the pipe news and all of this other stuff is just like more you know, you know, views on sort of that. And then on the new CO side, right, like, we're just. Companies don't even go to market anymore. Everyone gets preempted from what we. Like. I haven't had a company run a Series A or Series B process because it just gets preempted. So it's like, that's totally new. And I think part of it is everyone is front running Andreessen, General Catalyst, because they know those guys get in. It's hard to buy up your ownership. Yeah, yeah, totally. It's like, that's our strategy. Like, everything needs to be preempted, and it's like it's better just to focus on the 10 names you want to go after versus trying to just be reactive to deals that are in. Process. Yeah. Yeah. So I just think anything that's being widely shopped now is probably negatively selected, you know, in today's market, you know, and the problem with the preemption is, like, you have to be willing to pay a price that catalyzed that preemption, right? You're already kind of paying a premium to preempt something, right? Well, it's just. I think what ends up happening is that people just want to do it as early as possible so that the price doesn't get out of control. Right? It's like, you know, it's. It's very different if you have to preempt at 100 million or 2. Hundred million versus if you can preempt at 60 million, you know, something a little bit of know. But that's tough, right, because the investment committees want all the data and they want market analysis and et Storey and all the partners just want to win the deal, you know, at the like we're seeing on this later. Like the bees and the Cs. There's, like, a lot of companies out there that, like, have subtitle on the web, like, let's say like 7 million in revenue. And they don't need to raise, but, like. The right price for those businesses are probably around like. Like, good. Like, GROSS Prices, like 250 by 300, right? But they're only really in a, like, kind of like, be preempted at, like, 500. So it's either like we wait till we're 15 million.  Me: Hey, man, how are you?  Them: I am very good. I'm very well. Back. In the land of the well.  Me: Saddle. How bad was the man flu?  Them: It was bad. It was really bad. Yeah, it was nervous.  Me: X said it was over the weekend, too. As it always seems to be the way. Right? Like when you get sick. It's like, couldn't I got sick on a Monday.  Them: Yeah. Seven day. I never. I never get ill. So when I do, I'm like the worst patient. Like it's just me. It's just me that gets sick. No one else is aware. Really cool calls today.  Me: Nice.  Them: One with. So we're basically going. We're like fully going live with confused outcome badges for Go Enterprise. Like, enterprise sales is fun, but then, like, once you're actually live with a customer, that doesn't make it any easier.  Me: Yeah. Enterprise delivery is different.  Them: The whole that we just, like, we did three demo calls. They're engineering leaders, product leaders, senior leaders of, like, demos of the platform to, like, get them up to speed, onboarding, etc. And the intune leader one was semi awful. Because we basically the engineering managers. This is so boring. But engineering managers, like. They're incentive for this. Part of the we built isn't high, it's for finance. So we're making a thing that they have to do much nicer, but they hate doing that thing. So it's not. It's not. It's not that it's making error. We're just making their life easier. It's making finance much happier by making their life easier. So they were like, do we have to do this? Those days, what they were asking on the call, and we're like, that's not our problem.  Me: Yeah.  Them: And then we had a second call with our product team. And the product team was suggesting upsells. So that was very fun. They were like, oh, dude, that's for this, and you do this for this. And we were like, yeah. And they were like, do you also look at, like, AI cost and AI spend? And we were like, yeah. We did.  Me: Do you think it's worth on the engineering thread that you pulled up there, if that, is it going to be indicative of how other processes might go? Just like either doing that piece later or not at all. Right. Like, I. E. Let the customer instruct to get the engineers on board and sell to the finance people. In the course of the process, push down on the engineering team, but maybe not all up front, I don't know.  Them: Oh, no, we have to. I mean, this is like training them on how to use the software that they've bought.  Me: Right, okay, fine.  Them: Like it's there has to happen.  Me: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Understood. Yeah. Okay.  Them: And. And then I just got off with the financial controller at Plum Finance. And. She was like, this is, like, big priority for us. Like, would love to figure out how we can work together. So. Yeah, it's good. Starting to get some good pull on the same problem. Which is nice to see.  Me: Yeah, for sure.  Them: She was saying that like she used to work at Wise and Wise also really struggled with this too. So yeah.  Me: Yeah. Why is I've always found hard to sell into. They feel a little bit like Revolut to me, where they kind of want to just build everything themselves and be the masters of it. But, yeah, that sounds like it would be an ideal. I mean, really, the ICP today, what is the right organization size, do you think? For you, where's the sweet spot? Like in terms of how you can get in and sort of maximally show value over the 612 month period, what do you think?  Them: I think, like 50 plus engineers.  Me: Okay?  Them: For that before we built the product for Confused.com it was, I'd say, 100 plus engineers. But since we built this AI product that automates the attribution of engineering time for like essentially tax relief, we've built a product that enables R and D tax, ultimate credits and capitalization process. You can improve your PNL and balance sheet. So we can do that. We can save, like, countless hours across the year and then give them back a shit ton of money at the end of the year. And that process is currently so fucking manual because the data is in three different places and our platform centralizes all the data through APIs in one place and helps you fork and then enables you to forecast better, helps you see how engineering time is being spent, enables you to make more dynamic allocation decisions. There's the VC narrative and then there's that. I can actually tell you what my product does. But hopefully, you know, there's. There's kind of overlap.  Me: Yeah. No, no. Basically there needs to be a certain complexity in the organization. Where the value really starts to show is there's sort of inefficiencies that you can point to based on just lack of system or lack of forth or integration or something. I like that. The tax. That automation of the tax credit thing is awesome. Seems just like such a. Like a logical. Why would you not want that?  Them: Yeah, well, it's also just like AI Is now allowing us to do a huge amount of. Automation. Like, we built our writing assistant because part of the R and D tag stuff is like, writing the technical evidence. And so. Which is just such a fucking bollock for engineering teams. And so we basically built one trained on the legislative criteria by hmrc. And so it pulls your data from JIRA and then writes you to the evidence, whereas before, you're spending, like, hours and hours a month writing up all of the justification.  Me: Yeah. That's awesome.  Them: So it's really fun. It's really smart about what wells built. But it was from customer pool. This is exactly what confused.com are trying to sell for as well. At plum finance, at Credit so for so waveflower trend and so forth. So it's. Yeah, that's really.  Me: Yeah. I should introduce you probably to the CTO at ocralus, my last company I was at, which which just passed 50 million ARR in December and has a sprawling engineering team that I would Contest is minimum 50 across a few GEOs, very much looking at, you know, training models on expensive data sets and you know. I dread to think what gaps there are in that organization. So I should probably do that. I'll reach out to him and see if he wants to chat.  Them: Yeah, I couldn't say joe lowb as well. If that's helpful.  Me: Yeah. Dirt.  Them: Okay?  Me: All right. So anything else that, you know, feeling good about from just the week, or do you want to switch gears and, you know, try to round out some of this paperwork?  Them: Yeah. Yeah, I haven't. Let me explain it to me. I haven't. I've been on call since 3 till now.  Me: Oh, good. Maybe I can talk you through if you want.  Them: Let me click. I think I had a five minute Granola sent it to me.  Me: To be the V3 one that you can get. In.  Them: Yeah. Okay? Yeah. No, because. Because to be honest, I was basically dead until Wednesday. Ardville, Tuesday. So I've had about halfway. It's really like I couldn't breathe on Monday and Tuesday. Like, I was actually, like, forcing to take deep breaths.  Me: It's like a. Like a sort of Covid tainted flu, isn't it? It's like a mega flu.  Them: Yeah, it's really like. I don't know. Not to be too dark, but I typically think, like, if I was in Auschwitz, I wouldn't be complaining about this. But it still sucks.  Me: Have you ever read Victor Francol's book?  Them: Yeah, man's actually meaning.  Me: Yeah. I go back to that book every so often.  Them: To. Note.  Me: When I. When I get to in my own head about stuff I think is important, you know?  Them: Yeah, that and there's another book I love called the Choice by Edith Eger, another Holocaust survivor. Basically the premise. It's quite stoic about the premises. You're going to suffer. You don't have a choice. You do have a choice. How you respond.  Me: Why exactly? I mean. That's. That's the quarter life, you know.  Them: Okay? So early.  Me: Yeah. So, I mean, look, why don't I just talk you through it? Right? So based on what you. You shared with your, you know, we had the discussion, you shared the list, you know. There was main things that we focused on based on. Also the last, I think it was an email that you gave us. So we brought the equity grant amount down. We switched the vesting to match yours. I think the main thing that you wanted, we felt right, was, was. Was some, you know, honeymoon period ability to, you know, sort of, you know, not. Not a sort of crazy fixed as it initially was. So we've introduced that concept, which is just for the first 90 days. You know, you can. You can. You can terminate whenever you like. Any fees that would be due would be prorated up to that time. But sort of that, you know, that allows you to get out, basically, and then what we've asked for. But you know, I'm not wedded to. It's just that if there's termination after that point in the first year, so between, I guess, months three and 12, that the full amount becomes due. Now, that's just our hope. You know, we're saying it would suck if we got through the first 90 days and then terminate on month four. But as I say, I don't need that last clause if it's aggressive again. Right. Like, it's just some logic there for you. So that was. That topic.  Them: Got it. Got it. Yeah, I think that's still a bit of a. Aron.  Me: Yeah, like I can take the second part of it out. You know? What happens after that point, after the first 90 days?  Them: Yeah, I think that'd be good. I think. Fees accruing mix bands. I did. I do. This is actually something we do for our our customers, is kind of make the. I totally get it. It's. It's kind of. The point at which you start paying. Personally, I think that there's going to be. A REM period on your like, as you've mentioned, I think when we went for the walk, like, to bring value and I wonder, like, at what point does the do the fees start, I think is the question I have in my mind, like, what's, what's fair in terms of like, like, I guess when value starts really.  Me: Yeah.  Them: I don't have a particular answer.  Me: Well, we, you know. From when we start work is when we would expect to be compensated as pony agreement. Right. So from our perspective, it starts on on day one of the we know from whenever the thing is signed. With all the protections that you have around it, Right? So, like, nothing's actually due until collectively we bring in 2 million bucks into the business. Right. Which is what one F does on the exhibit. And then additionally, right, like, you can. You can, you know, quit within, you know, the 90 days. I don't know what. Would happen then, actually, in terms of. Because we say it's prorated, but then we haven't met the threshold. So I imagine that's in the language. But, you know, in that scenario, as I say, then it's prorated down to relatively small amount. So, you know, I think there's a fair amount of wiggle room that we've given on that side. Right. I mean, from our perspective, the work starts on day one. Like, it's no different to the work on day 31, right? Like we're still investing the time and the opportunity cost of not doing other stuff. From our perspective, the work is the same value whether it's on day one or 61.  Them: Yeah. I'm so curious, like, how. How. Think of like previous. Okay, the equity exposure. Okay, let me just look at the words.  Me: Yeah, so we did. The warrant percent is the same. You know, we kept that as what it was. What we changed was the type of stock to common. But then having done that, we wanted to reevaluate what the discount would be because, you know, there's typically a bit of a high discount on, on common. So I think We've made it 25% discount versus what we had, I think, was a 20% on preferred.  Them: It was 50 then. Did it go to Gran?  Me: Yeah. And I think the last one I put. We put to. Was it. Was it 80%. So, yeah, 20% discount. But that was on preferred. As I said, this is uncommon.  Them: Got it. I think. My issue is the word shall.  Me: Okay? Shall be equal.  Them: Because essentially. No, no, no. On. On the Warran terms, so essentially.  Me: Here. This one.  Them: Yeah, because. Or maybe the, maybe the kind of nuance here is that the 3% officer investor over four years and let's say series B happens. I don't know, let's say in four years or less. The reality is, and this is not about you personally, it's like for kind of non for an independent board members, as Matt kind of defined it. You could have. I'd say, like founder level. Like, really deadlifted to share capital in the business. Which I think. Would be still quite scary to potential vc. Coming in. And it's more the. Like, I would like. Yeah, I would like to be able to decide what the shape of the cap table looks like. It's series B. Rather than knowing in advance that I have a warranted grant to a member on the cap table.  Me: Okay?  Them: And I think. I think this comes back to the piece of, like. You know, if we're expert, you know, ever at that point, right. Where we're still working together at series B, the reality is, if you are, we are still working together, series B, then we're. We're in dreamland, right, because we're working together for years. And at that point, You know, it would be a conversation about. The optionality to to invest, right? Or the optionality to purchase shares. But it's I think its optionality, not kind of a defined.  Me: I mean, is the amount. Is it. You know, if it's. If it's three and three. Is that better? And maybe have we explained sort of the rationale about why we care about a warrant? Like, did we. Have we sort of talked about that? Like, would it help if I spend two minutes talking about it?  Them: Yeah. Yeah. I don't think I've heard the rationale for this.  Me: Okay. So, you know, the bigger picture for us is. I think I've mentioned to you that maybe I haven't. If I haven't, you know, my bad again. But for us this year, You know, at some point, we anticipate raising capital ourselves as Backbone to be able to deploy into our portfolio companies. And how that manifests itself in terms of who provides the capitalist family office. Is it, you know, vc? Is it like, you know, don't know yet. Right. Like figuring that stuff out. But we know, you know, we. We strongly believe part of the strategy. Is that it will be much more attractive for those LPs to know that, you know, for, you know, among the portfolio, there is the ability to get access into some of the top performing companies. At a later stage, we would take that warrant and go and structure an SPV around it and bring, you know, capital in. To the event, the spv, the vehicle. So through that lens, it's like we want to be able to articulate to potential future investors. Here is all the great companies and, like, you know, as of today, we have agreements in place that, you know, when we get to a certain point in time, you know, there's that opportunity there as well to double down, right? So that's why we care about it. You know, 5%, 3%. You know, I can, you know, I can reduce the 5%. Right. If that makes it feel better. Makes you feel better. But we would really love to have the concept in there for that strategic reason I mentioned.  Them: Got it. Okay? It's totally. I totally understand. You're sitting and thinking of that. And as like, I'm open to the warrant existing, but it's for me that, like, the definitive nature of it that I have. I have issue with. It's the. It's. Yeah, it's the. If there's a way that we could word it where there's a choice. I guess. On our site. On that. Yeah. Yeah. I think there, there has to be a choice on our side on whether.  Me: What about if it was tied to, like, an enterprise value number? So it was like, you know, only if the company is worth X or higher or something like that.  Them: No, because I think. I think that. I guess the point for me is even to kind of your advice around like shaping around, like shaping the B and us knowing that we have a percentage that is warranted to a party. Like we would want to look at the parties that we could give the kind of.  Me: Well, for sure. But, you know, we'd hope by that point. We would. Yeah. We've been working together for so long that, you know, it's like, it's. It's all, you know. That's baked in as part of the strategy. Right. Like, you're not. You wouldn't be farming it out to some people that you know, you don't know. It's the people that you know, in the ideal world, puts together your seed and your A as well.  Them: Yeah, for sure. And as I was saying before, like, if we're. If we're at that point, right. We're at series B. And even I'm talking about this. And the options there. Then why wouldn't you know? Why wouldn't I want to enable you to purchase? What would be the. And also you, right at that point, Series B, yours. Like, if you were buying up to that percentage, you know, your fund would also have to probably be on one or two, right? I don't know what you're raising, but far along in your cycle as well. So I think. I think the like sentiment is there. Like, yes. I suspect that you would be the partner we would want to bring on board the. If we're at that point, we're working together, things are going fucking well. But. The contract language is still like the company shall grant award.  Me: Right. I wonder if I don't know.  Them: I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know exactly.  Me: Right. I wonder whether it. I mean, I. If. If it persists that we would have the warrant if even if this thing was terminated. I mean, that doesn't make sense. Right? I'm with you. That. You know, in baby steps that start there. I don't know what the language here says about that, but. You know, can clarify that if at any point before that point we. We part ways, like the warrant is not valid anymore, right? I mean, what about that?  Them: Sorry. What's the what's sorry? How many was the condition?  Me: Would that get to where we need? I don't know if it's in. In the agreement already or not because I'm not a lawyer either. But, you know, if the agreement is terminated at any point before the event, like the series be, you know, the trigger, then. Then the warrant is no longer valid or. Something like that.  Them: I think that's. I think. I thought that was a given already.  Me: Also then. But wouldn't that then get out? I mean, because, you know, the future would either be we're all good and we're happy and, you know, it's all good, or we're not working together anymore, and so therefore, we don't have the warrant anyway.  Them: Yeah, no, I get that. It's just more like. It is. It is contractually baked in that if we are working together at that point, we are granting you a warranty purchase. A fixed percentage, and we are putting that in a contract when we are presche. And that's where my kind of resistance is coming from. Like, I would much rather say, like. Either. Either language that's kind of. Around again. I can ask you to look at it, but you know the kind of some conditional element or we, like, review this. If we're working together in a year, we revisit this point. I think. I just think that this piece is hard to say. Like, fixed. Yes. To at this before we've entered into a relationship.  Me: Even with all the protections that you would have of being able to. You know, it would just cease to exist if the thing was terminated before that point.  Them: No, because I really do want us to get to that point together. Right? Like, I. I don't. I don't want to.  Me: We're right.  Them: As I said.  Me: So if we assume that we are, like, that's that's what the warrant like, that's what the warrant's there. For. And if not, as I said, it's gone.  Them: Sure, but that's still just. That's just assuming that they're like, at 6:00. What I'm saying is. That do I know today that? In three years or two years whenever we get to Series B, depending on velocity of success. Do I know 2D in setting this contract where we're going to be one of our relationship, that I can agree to a fixed warrant at Series B, and that's my. Maybe this is something I need to take more, like take advice on.  Me: Yeah. I mean, think about it. I am also conscious. You said you had a hard stop. I don't know if that's still.  Them: I think that's my only real, like. Only, like, big sticking point, but I think it's just more in the, like, conditional. The conditional language.  Me: Yeah. I mean, look, if it's made conditional, it doesn't. It has kind of no real. You know, value. Right. Because it can just be denied the protections that I think you could have to me, you know, as I say, we're either going to be happy and knocking it out the park, or we've. We've parted ways by that point. Like, there's no. Isn't really a middle. Ground. So that's how I view it. But in any case, yes, I agree with you that that seems to be the last item. So why don't you just think about it? I can go away and confirm the position of the agreement with respect to that stuff. Anyway, and we can just, I don't know, chats on my own, round it out.  Them: Yeah, it feels. It feels like workflows. As I said, like, my goal is to move forward.  Me: Correct.  Them: But I. I'm conscious of all the mistakes I've made in the past around contracts I've signed. Thinking, going in there, just. On, like, yeah, I really want to do this and really like these guys. And then I forget that everyone has a lawyer.  Me: I hear.  Them: Every time I sign a contract, the goals we never have to relook at the contract. But sometimes you have to. Okay? So just to rent out the post honeymoon.  Me: Yeah. So I can scratch that, you know, I don't know. You know, again, the spirit of that is just to say. We don't really just want to do a 90 day thing either, right? So, like, you know, we need to think about. Need to think about the downside protection between months four and 12. But I'm not interested in over engineering this stuff either. So like, as I say, I'll go away and look at that. But like the spirit of what I said today to you is, you know, I'll remove the highly punitive language. That's in there today? Around months four to 12.  Them: Yeah, I think for me, it's. I mean, the cash implication is significant, but it's also the, like, accelerated vesting. I think I need to. I need to again have full.  Me: Yeah, that should have all that. That, that. Yeah. I mean, as it's, as it stands today, it's like if you terminated on day 91, you would owe the full amount as you would if you terminated on day 364. Right. You know, it's all or nothing after day 90 as it. Stands. Which is, you know, I'm happy to soften. That is my point.  Them: Yeah. I mean, you could do something like, you know, zero months doing first 90 days, one month during Fortress, age two to three thereafter, something like that.  Me: Yeah. Yes. Appreciate the collaboration. Yeah, I understood.  Them: Okay, cool. I've got to talk to my actual vc.  Me: All. Good.  Them: Cool. Thanks, Elliot. I appreciate it.  Me: Yeah, just chew on it. You know, you get why we care about it. I hear you, too. No one can see the future. You know, I've. I've tried to solve it with as many outs as I could give you while keeping the thing that I care about, so just. Just, you know, chew on it.  Them: Yeah.  Me: All right, buddy.  Them: Chair. S.
