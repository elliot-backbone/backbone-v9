 Them: Like you probably should have done something here. The issue. Is.  Me: I'm here, guys. By the way, I don't know if you can hear me.  Them: We put the volume on. All right, Here, let me.  Me: Yeah, so I joined, like, one minute ago.  Them: I was like, damn. We're just. Thank God. Did you. You missed five minutes ago. Right?  Me: All. Good. I joined one minute ago.  Them: Perfect. Missed when we were talking.  Me: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I let you guys do that first. Get out your system.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. So, Elliotr all we're looking at here. Just let me just. It's always important to explain how a model. All we're looking at here is we're mapping this number, this total dilution here.  Me: Yep.  Them: By this post Money valuation on the round we're doing right now.  Me: Yep.  Them: And then scenarioing that out by how much is Norwest versus how much is existing.  Me: Okay?  Them: It's all we're doing.  Me: So I'll pull this up on my side as well.  Them: And then. We were just saying Norwest would have to write a seven and a half million dollar check to get 10% ownership. The existing guys would put in 2.5 million as their pro rata and the post money would be 75 mil.  Me: That shakes out pretty much right on the money of what we were talking about yesterday, Mitchell, right?  Them: Yeah. Correct. And then I guess the question becomes, like, you know, there's no. Like. It's kind of like, Elliot, like we were saying, there's no point necessarily doing some vanity where we're, like, hustling them up to 100, 100, like, all of that stuff, like, you know, I think. The question becomes what you just.  Me: Well, I mean, have you. Have you discussed. I mean, do you want to talk about that?  Them: Yeah, well, that's, that's actually exactly what we were talking about right now. It's like, look, like, I'm sure if we got people in here, we could, we could certainly run the hustle them up game to a higher valuation. I think the questions on all these things, and maybe I've just changed a little bit from Lin table to now is like, there is an issue in just pushing the valuation. Like, the higher I put valuation, the more money I need to grab is like, well, and then the higher the next round needs to. Exactly. It's like, it's just. You're just setting the bar. So high. Yeah. And we were just talking about Elliot. Is there anyone that's not on this list, like an oak, like an F prime or whatever, they would want to potentially come in as well? Yeah. So. Because we don't. We didn't really leave any room for any new investors besides Norwest, which is. Fine. Unless we want to increase the round size, right? Like there's somebody we really, really like and we want increase it. So it'd be, you know, like the oaks of the world, the first primes of the world. First Mark is doing work right now. So.  Me: Yeah. I mean, again, the answer to that question is like, what value do they bring, right? To me, Oak has kind of blown hot and cold or kind of just generally a bit passive in this one.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Again, I think Mitchell comes back to what we were talking about of, like, what is the incremental value of A, like, more money or B, like, different types of money, right?  Them: Yeah.  Me: I don't have enough of a perspective on the first piece, right?  Them: Yeah.  Me: But I think. Yeah, we should. We should probably be notifying a couple of folks. I think, you know, we can probably notify Oak for sure. Like, you know, we can do most of that heavy lifting on our side and just, you know, pretty much communicate. Right. Like, unless there's something to talk about, like, you're not going to talk to Mitchell, you know, happy to do that, for example, but, like, overall, I think. This seems quite nice for what we wanted to achieve, which is, I understood from you, Mitchell was like a light, easy, uncomplicated process.  Them: Cor. Rect. Opportunity. Metrics. Process. How are we going in, like, ten minutes? Okay, so. Okay, so then maybe here's the thought. Right. I think we kind of know what it is, which is like, hey, we think that the total consideration that would make sense is around 10. We think that that is both with insiders. That gives us enough room to move fast. And also put our heads down and just really, really grind for the next, you know, year and change and get to our next milestones. The big thing we want to try to do is keep our. You know, we've looked at it from a dilution perspective. We want to add in. We're going to negotiate actually on 80. So it's. The storyline here is, you know, we want to try to keep the dilution in the round. To twelve and a half. Right? And honestly, we'll just make a nice whole round number and just say 12.  Me: Do any of the existing guys know about?  Them: No. So that was the other thing that we were talking about. I need to call and say, so the next the order of operations are we need to call each of the investors, tell them the good news that Norwest wants to like, that they want to start, you know, figuring out what a deal would look like. You know, the one thing we don't know going into that conversation with Jordan is what the insiders would like to do in the round. So we, before we have that sit down with them, We want to make sure that we understand what the, you know.  Me: Because, you know, it could go like, xfx, right? Like, as a theory, right? Like, where the insiders just say, like, no, we want this. And then.  Them: Yeah, they're not going to do that. Like the way Lair operates, I don't think that they're going to do that.  Me: We don't know. So the point is.  Them: We don't know. We didn't think Castle island was going to do it at XFX either, right? Yeah. Who knows?  Me: So we don't want to go sit down with Norwest.  Them: Okay, so here's. Here's. Here's. Here's what, then? So here's my talk track. I do need to go call Westbound. We need to check. I think we gave them super pirata. We need to, like, check those. We need to. Really need to check those. But, like, essentially the talk track. Really fast is. Hey. We think we want to do around a $10 million. That's a great slug. It doesn't scream Series A. It does. It screams, though. We get to go and focus. We want to bring around 12% dilution in this round. And that's a combination of you guys and existing. And we will make sure. And then he'll be like, well, that gets me to my 9% target. Can you make the dilution up to blank? And then we start negotiating on dilution, and then we have a hard stand in the ground there. The big thing I need to do right now is go to my cap table and say, hey, guys, they called me yesterday about, like, what are we thinking on numbers? Which means they're probably going to pop, write a check. I'm curious, you know, because the whole thing is, I want to say, effectively say, like, I'm not sure yet if I'm going to do this on a safe or a price. But, like, from my understanding, if this does end up being on a price, do you want to re up? But but it or does that not it doesn't matter. Right. It's like, as existing investors, do you want to I'm giving I'm always prioritizing, you guys. Okay, great. So it's like. And I just know if. If you would like to participate, and if so, like, what would be the right amount? Great. Okay. Ball in the airport. And then once I have that information, I can go. I can go back and more company. Okay, great. All right. I know what I need to do. All right, I got four. Calls to make. All right, let's do it. All right, guys. Thank you so much. All right.  Me: Alright, buddy, keep me posted.  Them: All right. Thank you so much for stopping by. Next week, too. Say less. Like lunch. Yeah, let's do it. And then also just again, like.
