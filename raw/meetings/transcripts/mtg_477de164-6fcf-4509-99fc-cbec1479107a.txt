 Them: Hello.  Me: Hey, buddy. I was literally just about to hop off here.  Them: Sorry. Hopefully you got my email, did you?  Me: No, I did not. But it's all good, man. There's this stuff happens.  Them: My sorry. I.  Me: No, all good. Can you hear me? Okay, I'm in the back of it. I'm in a cab, actually.  Them: Oh, no worries. Here, I'll go. Off too, because otherwise I'm just looking at myself. No, sorry. I had a forced Microsoft update, and then I couldn't get the Zoom link out.  Me: Yeah. Hey, when it happened. Cool, man. Well, Kishore introduced us.  Them: Yes. Plug and play.  Me: Would love to know a little bit about you. Of course, the reason he introduced us, I don't know what background, if at all, if anything, he shared. Is that we Myself and a couple of partners in the States. You can tell I'm English. I spent five years in New York, but currently back in London. But the rest of the team? Two guys in New York, one got one in D.C. we run Backbone, which. Is an incubation focused venture advisory firm. I would call it tricky. We're trying to figure out how to more concisely label us, but by the end of the year we will be a precede and seed focused investment fund. We're going to go raise some money this year, but in the meantime We've been amassing a portfolio of companies that, for the most part, over the past sort of 15, 16 months, We've been involved in from sort of day zero in their relative formations, putting the teams together in some way or ideating the product or whatever it is, but from the earliest stages, helping put the first round together, coaching the founders through that process, working with the investors on the other side to kind of join everything up. And hopefully make everyone somewhat happy. And then typically, the work in between the rounds is typically around the stuff you would expect, right? Like hiring, helping put people in place that we know, that we like, we trust that the business needs, obviously.  Them: Awesome. And is it is you? Are you guys cut any specific way? Geography, space, whatever? I know you mentioned your DC here in London.  Me: Yeah. I mean.  Them: Right.  Me: Mostly. I mean, look, we all grew up in financial services like Fintech, for the most part, right? So I would say, naturally, there's a broad umbrella of financial services, and then underneath that, I'd say that the themes that have come out have been more bottoms up in, like, so far, as we kind of just keep a network of people around us that are operators, that are either CEOs at current things and jamming and stuff on the side, or trying to figure out what to do next or whatever. It is. And we'll kind of look to that pool of information, if you like, to sort of tease out what seems to be the thing, and then marrying that up with, obviously, what investors are investing in. And so through that stablecoin infrastructure, we've got a bunch of stablecoin infrastructure stuff. We've got more vanilla crypto things. We've got AI vertical AI application, like a new erp. I'd say stablecoin or crypto infrastructure, say payments related to that and kind of B2B payments, and then I'd say lending fintech and then some vertical AI sprinkling in there as well.  Them: Awesome. Very, very much aligned.  Me: And then territory wise, you're back to that point. Most of it's us. I'd say the portfolio today is probably like. I'd say, well, let me correct myself, not us, but the Americas. We have quite a bit in Latin America, as you can imagine, on the stablecoin payments side. That's typically where these things are in the developing world. And then a bunch of just regular US mainland stuff. And then I have a few things in Europe. But the more interesting action is in the States. The European investors are a bit too cautious for my liking. I don't know. That will be a huge part of our business in the future, but maybe we'll.  Them: Okay? Got it. Great. Well, happy to share on our side. Or what? I'm looking at our scope and, yeah, I can go from there.  Me: Yeah, for sure. That would be most interested in just, you know, the way I interact with Kishore, for example, sharing deal flow. Right. Like socializing what we have coming down the pike and seeing if that matches with whatever it is that his priorities are and, you know, if there is a deal to talk about or a company. To talk about, then typically, we just get out of the way. Right? Like, we just, you know, introduce you to the founder, and then off you go, and we'll kind of deal with it on the back end. Right. So, yes, as much as you can share about kind of what you care about and what the firm is. An overall cares about, you know, that's. That's most important to me.  Them: Great. Well, we're institutional, global generalists. Multistage VC firm, as I'm sure you know. By that I mean we're kind of as multi stages. They come by that. I mean, there is no sweet spot. There's no typical check in this fund. I think we'll have checks as early and small as. Half a million million bucks. And as big as 200 million bucks. So it's everything and anything under the sun. Myself, I focus on fintech. I help lead our fintech strategy here. Most of the stuff that I look at is early by our standards, meaning sea to Series B, C, call it and in particular seed Series A I think is probably in this climate, probably where I'VE been spending most of my time. We have the mandate to do anything and everything. So last big deal was in Brazil. So also can be global. Working on something right now out of Europe. So, like, very much can be global, but I would say probably 75% is us. And I've been spending most of our time in stablecoin stuff. In some of the AI Stuff. I think we think about it a little bit differently in that. I don't know. I guess, like, maybe we're just a little bit more price sensitive than some of the stuff that we've seen on the. At least when it, when it makes its way to the rounds that we get most excited about. Some of the just AI, almost like verticalized SaaS or functional AI SaaS for financial services that gets marked up so high it becomes difficult. But we definitely have an interest in it. We've been paying attention, maybe more from a distance on some of the agentic transactions stuff. Yeah, I'd say that's where we've been spending most of our time. And, yeah, to your point about how you guys interact with Keisha, I think we're similar. Like, we love sharing stuff, seeing stuff and sharing stuff, and just sort of keeping an open. I like what you said. Like, getting out the way. Stuff that we see. And, you know, over time, as we share more and more stuff. Seeing what you guys like, what you don't like and iterating from there.  Me: And what do you have? So how does the firm work? So, like, do you. Are you yourself. You're a partner, right? Like, you write. You sponsor your own deals, write your own checks. What does the IC look like? Like, how often do you guys do deals?  Them: Good questions. We probably do. We have a tech team and a healthcare team on the tech team. I don't know, maybe two to three a month. And. Probably two to three months. Any deal that we do. We are definitely not a franchise model. So for any deal get to get done, even if no matter what your, you know, you could have been at the firm for 30 years. You could have been at the firm for three years, three months. We need to get consensus. The reason that we do that is, you know, things happen. People move people. People's focus evolves. Like, we want to make sure that you're doing a deal with Anya, not with Hunter, not with whoever. So things tend to be, I would say, on the scale of multi stage, big, multi. Stages or on the more consensus side we're on, the more we do have an ic. I wouldn't over orient on it because I think anything that goes through a formal IC goes through a more informal conversational triangulation.  Me: Right. Right? You don't. You don't take something up there that you're not going to get done, basically.  Them: Exactly. So and so, basically, anytime that I get excited about something, you know, I talk to the right constellation of people, which could be, say, I mean, a really exciting company in Europe. We have a partner. We have two partners that sit in London. Like, I'd want them to get involved, uncover Europe. I'd want them. To get involved. And then let's say it's a payments company, I'd want to get involved. A colleague of mine who has a lot of experiments, experience in payments, and say that Berkeley grad and PhD from Berkeley, you know, maybe I want to get involved, someone who's plugged into that ecosystem. To understand and try, you know, like, I want to get the right deal team.  Me: Y. Eah.  Them: Bring together the right deal team and they're all excited, then generally, things get through at sea relatively easily.  Me: Y. Eah. And how, how. And so for you personally, what do you have for the, for the year in terms of like, you know, how many do you need to get done? Remind me. Current fund, like you mentioned, there's a very broad check size range, but like, where are you? And it's sort of deployment and like pacing. Like, you know, how is that factoring into what you particularly need to do for the year?  Them: We're at the end of this fund, and we'll be transitioning to a new fund in a few months, so.  Me: Okay? Okay? So for now, kind of buttoned up, like, you know, down the fairway, if at all, and then. And then, once new funds out,  Them: I. Realistically, I'm probably not doing anything until we make. Until we make the transition. Maybe a smaller seed, but probably nothing. And then, you know, to the same franchise. Like, we're not. I would like to do. I would say somewhere between, like 1 and 3, depending on size. Right. If I like one big series B. Or three small seeds or something like that. Like, that's sort of.  Me: Okay?  Them: Our model is a little bit different than, say, some of the other multistages. And we reserve a lot of capital. So we have a big fund like this last one was six and a half billion. Yet that two to three, I think, is low for a six and a half billion dollar fund. The reason is like, if we, if we underwrite a $15 million Series A, we're reserving a multiple of that in follow on. And so.  Me: Right. Right. Put a lot of pressure on you to make the right bets.  Them: That's right. Yeah. So.  Me: And how have your, you know, what would I know? Any deals that you personally have done, you know, how are they doing? How are you doing?  Them: Good. I mean, we have one right now that is going up for series C called Slash, which is the fintech space that we think will. We think will price in at the lowest end, like maybe a billion and a half.  Me: Oh, yeah, yeah.  Them: And then we have one called Latitude, which is actually just coming out of stealth. That should raise a really nice A in the next month or so. And then I have one that we wired six months ago in Brazil that since we wired, they've doubled top line. We haven't. We just did the round six months. Ago, so there's no new mark, but feel very good about that.  Me: Y.  Them: So, yeah, it's a good portfolio. And then I'm obviously preceded. I've built the firm for five years, but I'm preceded by an amazing. Heritage in fintechs.  Me: Eah, Nice deals anyways.  Them: We were the product. Yeah. So anyway. But the party number one for me is honestly on the stablecoin side. I think I will. I would say this rather than how many deals I need to get done this year, I will consider 2026 a failure if I didn't. Take a big swing in something exciting and stables. So that that's how.  Me: Yeah. Well, we've got. I mean, that's. That's fortunate because we've got. So I'm just trying to. I'm trying to type out some, some of the. I mean, I'll give you some examples of guys in the portfolio that are in that space. I mean, we've got. Yeah. We've got so many. Well, I say so many. We got sort of 4 or 5, which is out of a portfolio of like 15 to 20 is probably too many, but so, like, do you know xfx, for example?  Them: They do. Yeah.  Me: Yeah, so, like.  Them: Out of new york.  Me: Well, XFX is. They're in. Well, they're all over the place. They're in Mexico. They're in.  Them: Wait. Am I thinking of something different? Oh, I am.  Me: Yeah. The website's xfx IO.  Them: Yes. And d.c. right? Is that. Am I right about that?  Me: I don't know.  Them: No. Okay.  Me: Xfxio. We did the seed, you know, that was an incubation that we did. 10 million seed. That was done by Horn and Oak and Castle island and a few others. In the summer. We have Checker. So Checker is in New York. If you know Checker.  Them: On the kyc side.  Me: No, not not Checker without it's Checker Finance. The website is horrible with redoing the website, but check a quite similar.  Them: Okay? Okay?  Me: In concept to xfx, but. So Checka's just done. Confidentially, I come out some point soon. I imagine it led by Galaxy Six Million Dollar Round, something like that. So that's another one that's firmly in the stablecoin infrastructure world. I think we have cedar. So, like cedar money. Which is b2b payments. That's benji feinberg, who you may know because he was the CEO of behalf in new york.  Them: Oh. I do? We chatted, actually. Maybe about a year ago. He was building in Africa. Is that right?  Me: Yeah, like benjun. O. Correct? Yeah, he's. Well, yeah, Emerging market again, you know, much of the value of much of the real use cases that you actually driving real valued today in the real world or is in, you know, sort of developing world international payments. Right. Like emerging markets to establish markets. So he gets kind of down, he gets dinged. Because rightly or wrongly. Obviously wrongly. Like, you know, the word Africa gets people sort of frightened.  Them: Yeah. Yes.  Me: So, yes, he himself is South African, so there's also that component to it. But, you know, it's really, it's. It's emerging markets more than any one particular. But, yes, Benji is another one. So Matt led the. So my. One of my partners in Backburn is Matt Burton, who led, you know, seed and precede at QED for five, five and a bit years. I've known Matt for for my whole career. Basically.  Them: And the benches. Company, right? Was. Was qed company. I think that's like a.  Me: So that's what. Yeah, so Matt led the seed in cedar when he was at qed, and so then that's one that we've kept moved into Backbone. So, anyway, so, you know, we know Benji for a long time. We have Trace Finance in Brazil. Which you may.  Them: True. I know them very well. I've had them in our office a couple times. Yeah.  Me: Interesting. Yeah, so. So, yeah, that. That one. That one is more run by Matt. But he earns that one on our side. But, yeah, we have trace one that we have that's kind of. You know, in market right now, insofar as your first round is coming together, it's looking like is a company called Double Sharp, which I can send you a memo on if you get when you get off the phone. But Double Sharp is basically the dedicated liquidity network or provider for all these guys, right? Every single one of these guys, like the XFX's, the checkers, like the, you know, you know, Bridget Bridge, pre acquisition and all these sorts of folks, they have to go and bolt on, like the liquidity, like in every kind of. In every, you know, territory they're in, got to go and set up. The sponsor banks and getting it's just a complete operational nightmare. And so, and we've seen it in our companies. And so Double Sharp is going to be the dedicated kind of balance sheet provider, sort of on a quasi global basis. And it's confidentially, for whatever that's worth, it's looking like Vanek is gonna is going to lead that with a relatively small equity check, a couple billion bucks, I think. But most importantly, putting balance sheet in place of 15 million credit facility, which is the main value for us there. So that round is getting sort of filled out and optimized and, you know, stuff now currently. So if that were of interest, you know, I maybe try and get you an intro there, but it may also be too late. Right. Like, I'd need to check on how far along we are there, but that's one that's coming down. We got a couple of others as well, but that's the most recent one.  Them: Yeah. That sounds awesome. And I. Yeah, I know. I was never able to chat with fxfx, and if it ever becomes actionable, I would love to meet them. But all of those sound fantastic.  Me: Yeah. I mean, with xfx, we just got preempted. Well, again, between us, a lot of these guys, as I'm sure you're finding, like, the best stuff, like, it just never comes to market anymore. Right. Like you don't even need it. And. And with xfx, over the course of the last two months that happened there. Again, we got a, you know, preempted by. Well, we were preempted by an outsider that ultimately the insiders just decided to do the whole thing at like a forex markup or something like that.  Them: Yeah. Yeah.  Me: So, so that one is, is kind of, you know, back to execution mode, but it can certainly keep you in the loop. Well, I can absolutely do is get you on the investor update list, email for it, because we write them.  Them: That would be great. Yeah. And then for you guys, is it. Is it most helpful to. Excuse me. To, given where you guys sit, like is the thing that's most helpful. You know, founders who are tinkering, or would you guys do something that's not incubated, sort of precede seed?  Me: For sure. No, we would. You know, part of the value that we're trying to create is to be sort of long term partners. And so to be able to be useful long term, like, we need to, you know, our skill set needs to, you know, we need to flex the muscle at the various stages. Right. We also have a corporate incubation. With JP Morgan Go for example which is about to be funded new co created that they're going to fund mortgage mortgage collateral tech solution. Boring. But you know, just on the other end of the spectrum. Right. Those are corporate incubation there. But so like we have a couple of the latest stage customer we have is Wayflyer, which is, again, another QED company. And, you know, they're doing 100 million in revenue, right? So, yes, I'd say, like it's 80. 80% of our time would be on net new incubations, and then the rest is reserved for other strategic stuff where it makes sense.  Them: Yeah. Okay, makes sense. Well, then I will think of you guys as I see super early stuff, especially.  Me: Yeah. But as I say, I think from our side, I think mainly it's, you know, the value that you would bring would just be like giving us a quick yes, no on, you know, just look interesting, does it not? And then, you know, if you, if you do, if you do engage, then just sort of being, being kind. Of, you know, helpful with kind of the navigation of the conversations, if you like, with us in parallel, you know.  Them: Well. Absolutely. Well, that I can certainly do. And I appreciate it. That. I mean, that's great.  Me: Cool, man. I'm glad.  Them: We have a ton of overlap.  Me: I'm glad you showed me the intro. Also, you. You're in New York, right?  Them: Yeah.  Me: Yeah. So, as I say, two of our guys are in New York, but Matt in particular, you might want to meet at some point. He's in the city most Wednesdays. So, yeah, as I pass this call back through the team, you know, like, I'll flag that. And, you know, if we. If we do collaborate, on something. I mean, the double shop deal that I. The company I talked to you about, Double Sharp, the VanEck one. I think even Chris, the CEO, Chris. I think he might be in New York as well. So if there is potential or desire or appetite there to have a conversation, then obviously I'll introduce you, but. But if not, then, then I also just, you know, I'll let you know. Letting you know that, you know, there are folks from Backbone that are in the city that you could meet as well.  Them: That sounds great. Yeah.  Me: All right, buddy.  Them: And you're. You're. You're. You're usually in London.  Me: Yeah, I'm in London. You know, I'm back over there once a quarter, usually. I've had been raising a puppy for the past year, so been reluctant to travel but. But I will be.  Them: Okay? Well, I'm there at least once or twice a year, so can also do that.  Me: Cool. Man. Yeah. Let's just stay in touch.  Them: On both sides.  Me: As I say, I'll see if there's anything to be done in the immediate term, but. But yeah. If not, just yeah. I'll make sure that I get you on the relevant updates and we'll send across any memos that. So the thing you'll always get from us is a two page, memo. You know, problem, solution. You know, why now? Product, team, all that stuff. And so that serves as, like, the quick sniff test of whether you like it or not.  Them: Awesome. I appreciate that.  Me: All right, but it talk soon.  Them: Okay? Bye. See Elliot.
