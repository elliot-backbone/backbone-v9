 Me: Hey. Man.  Them: Hey.  Me: How are you doing?  Them: Good, good. Long time no talk.  Me: Yeah. Can you hear me okay?  Them: I can. I can.  Me: Okay. I'm in a taxi.  Them: Bye. No worries.  Me: Yeah, if you don't.  Them: I'll shut my video off.  Me: Yeah. You'll just have to remember my face. My pretty face. And your mind. Yeah, it's been a little while. Wait up to these days.  Them: Oh, man, I have. I left new york about right after Covid.  Me: Yeah, me too. I actually left on March 13, 2020.  Them: Vaccines and everything. Wow. Okay. Yeah.  Me: So it was, I think, the last helicopter out of Vietnam, you know.  Them: I'm assuming you're back in London, then?  Me: Correct. Yeah.  Them: In Portland, Oregon. So slightly different from London. But, yeah, I've been here for about four, four and a half years or so. I mean, there was family reasons, but I also think I just needed to get out of New York for a little while. Although I miss it. I do miss it.  Me: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know how I feel about new. I mean, don't get me wrong. I love. I love going there to visit when I. When I have to go there for business.  Them: Yeah.  Me: But I. I do. I do look back at it and think, how did I. How did I do this every day? You know, like, you know, the energy and the noise and the people and.  Them: I feel like that's kind of what I'm. That's kind of what I'm missing. I'm itching for that a little bit. But I guess I can get my. I can get my fill if I go to travel.  Me: Balance is, you know, it's important. Right. I suppose you're going to always grab everything, and I suppose that's, you know, fair enough. Like, I do. I do scratch that itch when I. When I go there. But, you know, I've spent some time out in the Caribbean. I live in Jamaica for. A couple years as well. I've sort of been kind of running around doing stuff, but so, you know, you can imagine Manhattan is quite a bit different to. To. To. To Montego Bay, Jamaica.  Them: When you need to. Nice. Well. Yeah, exactly. So what have you been doing, then? I mean, that sounds like remote work.  Me: Yeah. I mean, look, I was. Yeah, I mean, up until. So even though I left New York, as I said just before Covid, I was still working at a New York fintech. I was just in London doing it. Specifically a company called ocralus.  Them: Okay? Oh, yeah, I know those guys.  Me: Yeah. And left the company in 20 end of 2023. I'd done five and a bit years there, so did my time.  Them: Okay?  Me: And bummed around for a bit, took some time off, and then. And then it just so happened that Burton, you know, Matt. Left qed so after orchard. Matt didn't go along to Cabbage. He didn't go along on that ride.  Them: Yeah, I remember. I remember you went to QED, too. I mean, I've seen them on LinkedIn and all that, but, yeah.  Me: So he was. He was. He did qed. He went to the dark side and was an investor. QED for five, five and a bit years. Just so happened that he and I left our respective gigs around the same time. And we were just catching up. At one point at QED he was sitting on, like, 15 different boards or something crazy.  Them: Yeah.  Me: And as he left QED, you know, a bunch of these CEOs said to him, you know, we want to keep you around. Like, you know, we understand you have to kind of formally get off the board or whatever, but, but, but we want to keep you around maybe as an independent board member or as an advisor. Or something like that. And, you know, we both know Matt, and, you know, Matt's very good at some things, but, you know, struggles maybe sometimes to kind of actually do stuff, you know, hands on keyboards, sort of, you know.  Them: Right? Yeah, yeah.  Me: He's a walker, but, you know. You know, so sometimes struggles elsewhere. And I can say that because I love him very dearly. He basically called me up and was like, look, I've got, you know, handful between five and 10. And he sort of like, CEO advisory engagements that I got loads of stuff I'VE got to do, like, can you help me out? How that's fast forwarded now all the way through, you know, 15, 16 months later. We are an incubation focused venture firm. I mean, yeah, we haven't raised any money yet, but we're going to this year, so. So we will be a, you know, a seed precede investor, focus on you. Know, creating companies that are the day zero stage, you know, from. From formation onwards, broadly speaking, within financial services. And there's a few buckets underneath that. How we've. What we've been doing up till now is, you know, amassing a portfolio in size that's probably quite similar to a small precede. Or seed firm. Anyway, in terms of the equity positions we're getting. Except we're massing them through sweat, not. Not through cash. Right? So we're doing the. We're doing work. And in exchange, we get, you know, decent equity grants in the business, 3 to 5% range.  Them: Okay? Okay? Yeah. Right. Nice.  Me: We pay ourselves some cash and, and then we have a warrant structure that allows us to buy more of the business in the future at a discount, ideally up to about 10% ownership, which usually is what a, you know, a precede investor would be looking at and target target ownership anyway. And so the idea is, you know, one, obviously, we're building a business. So we've, you know, it's, it's been good to figure out how to kind of put companies together. And, you know, we've done a bunch now, like, from day zero like that, we've probably done. Seven or eight of those over the last 12 months or so, where we've sort of either put the help, put the teams together or if founding teams together, or have been involved in some kind of ideation or, you know, something pre formation usually, and then, you know, driving it through funding the first time around.  Them: Got it. Got it.  Me: You know, putting the round together, help coaching the founder on how to fundraise, kind of, you know, working the network in the background and back channeling with the, with the investors.  Them: Y. Eah. I mean, for what it's worth, that is Matt's superpower, it seems, like, right. Like he's really good at that, so.  Me: Yeah, exactly. Typically, we want to stay engaged all the way through to the company kind of, you know, growing up and exiting or some kind of liquidity event. And so, you know, that's why we have the warrant in place. But so the work, you can view the work as sort of anchored around a fundraising rounds. And then we typically just work backwards from six months from there to do the actual sort of, to make sure that the business is actually in shape to, to, to have successful rounds. So, like, you know, usually it's hiring great people, ensuring that their customer pipeline is solid, that they, you know, giving introductions to targets on the customer side. You know, helping on legal and regulatory compliance stuff.  Them: Right.  Me: So the team is. Is not just me. Me and Matt. There is two other partners too. Another one was. One of them was another CEO at qed. Justin Gilder is his name. He was the CEO of a company called Reserve Trust.  Them: Okay? I don't remember him, but. Okay?  Me: So he's like our lawyer. He's a lawyer by trade, but he's a business, you know, guy. He was a CEO.  Them: Gotcha.  Me: And then another guy called Alex Pedraza, who was formerly the GM at Cap Chase in New York. You know, the plan. Yeah, the plan for this year is, as they say, to sort of parlay. We'll start to behave like a fund or, you know, we're going to, you know, report on the portfolio as if it, you know, as if it's. I mean, it is a fund zero.  Them: It's a lot, dude. Y.  Me: But, you know, use that to go out as a proof point and piece of data to actually go and raise a small first fund in itself. Right. So being able to say, like, look, out of these 6, 7, 8, 9 companies that we've done already through the model that we have, six of them have already done another round, a significant markup. Like, you know, the overall the performance is looking like this. You can imagine if he had cash. And so that's the ambition.  Them: Eah. Y.  Me: So, yeah, it's going to be a busy year, but it's been a lot of fun.  Them: Eah. No, it's awesome. It's excellent. I mean, it's. Fundraising is. We're finding definitely challenging on multiple fronts. So from my. What I did after Orchard was I went. I almost went. I almost joined Oculus as their cmo. I got an offer from them. But I got. I ended up getting an offer from I Capital as well.  Me: That's funny. Okay?  Them: And at the time, I Capital was, there were only like, 50 people there. But you could tell that that firm was going to explode just based on who they were and what they were doing. So I was at I capital for about three years, and we went from 50 people to 500 people. We went from 6.5 billion on the platform to, like, 80. 80 billion or something. It was nuts. And we went from like, I was basically, I joined them to help them launch funds into market. Like, they didn't have anybody that understood how to launch funds. They didn't have anybody that understood how to actually talk to financial advisors or sell into that channel. So my job was literally to build the marketing call it wholesaling distribution function from scratch in partnership with the marketing team, and we killed it. Things were going great, but then I needed to get out of New York and they don't have remote options for people, so I moved and I ended up going to crowdstreet next, which was. They're like a real estate platform now. I think they've got. They've got somebody from I Capital. As their CEO now, and they're trying to become like an alternative investment, broadly speaking, platform. I don't know how well, really. I haven't really talked to many people since I left there. But then. So call it. Three years ago, two and a half years ago, I met somebody in Chicago that was loosely related to all the People for Men investments that I knew. And he was spinning up an asset management business called ThirdWire Asset Management. And the idea was he had a partner called Ketera Strategies, which is an alternative investment platform as well. That they were mostly focused in the institutional channel. And so what they wanted to do is basically launch the Cataract style funds. And the strategy, they're mostly managed futures and commodity trading advisors. They wanted to launch their fund into the private wealth channel. And so they started this firm, Third Wire Asset Management, in order to do that. I joined. Probably I'll say too early in that I've basically just been working for equity for them for the last two and a half years. But I figured, you know, I've helped people raise, literally not patting myself on the back, billions and billions of dollars for funds. Whether at Man Investments or at all my time at I Capital, and I'm not still seeing a cut of that. So the idea with Third Wire was join early, help them kind of in an advisory role from marketing perspective. And when things start to pick up, I actually own a chunk of that business and have some skin in the game there. So I've been doing that for a while, but at the same time, I met them. I met this kid, I'll call him a kid, he's in his 30s. But I met this guy who, you know, he's a Michigan grad, but he was dual citizen, so he's Japanese citizen and a U.S. citizen. And he wanted to move back to Japan, so he did that right after Covid. As well, and he's currently in Japan, but he's basically data science, mathematician. Who understands the importance of AI and he wanted to apply it to what he figures. And I am in a full agreement. One of the most valuable sectors is finance. Like, if you're going to apply a new technology to a marketplace, That'd be the one. Not just because that's where all my experience but that'd be the one I do it in. So he and I have been call it doing light consulting. The idea behind what we started doing was people need to figure out how to apply this technology. I've got deep skill and I've got a network. So let me just start helping introduce people to Sean and the team and help start talking about what problems they have, like what kinds of things and how AI or just data science in general could be applied to whatever their organization does. But we figured eventually we would stumble onto, through these conversations, something that could be a product that we could actually turn into a business. And me, I'd been itching since OpenAI. OpenAI and ChatGPT launched. I've been trying to figure out how do I apply this to marketing? How do I apply this to fund sales? How do all the things that I was trying to do at I Capital, meaning take their technology stack and upgrade it, make it so that salespeople actually have insights? To the entire system that like at I Capital, for example, somebody, our sales team, initially we didn't know when somebody was logging into the platform. So we had 14,000 advisors on the platform and we didn't know day to day who was visiting and doing and what. It was insane to me. So most of my time. For the first two years was explaining to people why sales needed this information and then figuring out, okay, how do we get an integration with Salesforce and the platform? How do we get Salesforce integrated? We were using HubSpot to do the marketing thing. How do I get my sales team a report on a daily basis that shows which of their prospects and which of their clients have visited the website and. Or read content and, like, all those things. So I had this vision of, like, in a future state. A salesperson should be able to just log into their system and go, okay, here's the current state of all of my. Call it my, my personal pipeline, my region. And here's where my contacts are doing. Here's what my actual clients are doing. Here's some, call it light coaching. And some things that I can do, call it content to help nudge people through the pipeline. Because in our, in this business, You're never going to automate the sales process. People aren't investing $5 million, a million dollars, $100,000 in a fund without talking to a person. So it's always going to be high. Touch. The problem is that the sales people spend way too much time dealing with I got to get a list from somewhere because I'm prospecting, okay? Now I've got to go research everybody on this list and figure out who's a good fit. Then I got to go figure out if Bob is actually a Bob or is he a Robert? Or does he go by some other nickname like all of that little high touch research things that you have to do to start engaging in selling into the private wealth chair in particular. So it turns out that, like, AI is probably a great. Solution for that. So that's what we built over the last. Call it. Year and a half, we've been like, having conversations with people. Everybody I've talked to, meaning I've talked to a lot of financial advisors. I've also talked to people trying to sell to financial advisors. When I explained to them what it is that we're building, they're all kind of like, yeah, I would use that. Like, they all go. There's, like, you know, Discovery Data Advisor Pro. There's a firm called Broadridge. There are all these firms that, like, offer lists. Basically, like, pay us $1,000 a month to get access to this database. That's literally just everybody that's in the SEC's database. And so what we did is we scraped the entire SEC website, or the. It's called the IAP database. We basically built our own database of every RIA that's registered with the SEC and with the state and with all the broker dealers that are in finra. Broker check. And put that into two different databases. One is just your standard kind of traditional database. The other is we took all of the brochures and all of the language documents, basically, that you get advs that are filed that they have to file every year. Those are in a chroma database. So embedded, and you can do semantic search, so, meaning you can connect a chatbot to them. And then we're building a chat system on top of it. So the current state of our world right now is that we've got a database that you can go to and say, here's my company, here's my fund. I wish I could show it to you. Maybe we can set up a demo. Sometime in the next week or so. But, like, basically, you could take a deck, I could point it, and I did, just to test it. I'll send you the link after the call. Here's Pluto Financial. Go to their website. Build a one page profile on who they are.  Me: Y.  Them: Okay, now that you know who they are. Figure out who their ICP is. Okay. Now you know, okay. They want to sell into, call them alternative investment platforms. They want to sell into wealth managers who have clients with basically high net worth clients. So alternatives, focus and high net worth clients. Or you want to sell to fund managers that have a large number, particularly private equity. Funds or, you know, private credit funds that long term lockups that basically these funds that have a large number of high net worth clients in them. So the thing that you can do with the system is start to build those profiles. And then the beauty part of having it connected to the database of who all these RIAs are is that. Then you can say, well, go build me a list of them. Now you've got the. Yeah.  Me: Eah. So let me. So I just forwarded you. I don't know if we talked about this at all. You brought up the name Pluto.  Them: You sent me a link and said,  Me: Okay? Excellent. Okay, so we did talk about it. So keep this. Don't send this anywhere. This. This memo that I just sent you. But it's actually a work in progress as well. But it's a high level overview of the business that might allow you to be a bit more targeted. Even you hit the nail. On the head. I think of sort of, you know, from go to market standpoint, the sort of the broad categories of icp. I think for Pluto, the challenge will be I see this business as quite channel driven, right? Like they've got a number of channel partnerships, like with the folks like, you know, the I capitals. Exactly.  Them: That. Okay, said Moonfair and y.  Me: So I wonder how might they. Because what I would love to do, I mean, I think at the very least, if you would be open to it, I think I can show you to nail the CEO there, because it seems like you guys would have a lot to talk about anyway. But I wonder whether, you know, how. How does the tool in your mind, look for that kind of strategy.  Them: So, for example, we know at I Capital, I Capital's client base, they're everybody that's in this database. So all the financial advisors that are advising clients to invest in alternatives on the I Capital platform.  Me: Okay?  Them: Every single one of those firms is in that database. It's maybe not disclosed whether they have a direct relationship with I Capital. But the point being is once you identify the characteristics of who those advisors are, the system has access to. It's got every single firm. So it goes at the firm level, but then it also has everybody that's a registered rep. So everybody that at the firm, certain individuals, depending on what they do at the firm, have to register with the SEC as well. So there's like 400 some thousand of those people. And the objective with the system is, is you find who those target people are. So it's almost like a look alike, but you basically define that audience.  Me: Right, okay. Y.  Them: Figure out how you want to. Maybe build a campaign. So here's one example you could do. You could say, okay. We know what our ICP is for this specific segment. So we want to go after all the financial advisors that have high net worth clients of a certain size. All the financial advisors that have aum of a certain size. And they're all based in New York, where they're all based in Pennsylvania.  Me: Ep.  Them: Let's do a campaign now that we know who all the firms are and we know who all the registered reps are at all of those firms. And we can also go out and do additional supplemental research to find out who really are the decision makers.  Me: Right.  Them: Then you turn that information into a campaign that you can start to run content marketing, which is how it moves the needle for all of these people anyway. So you tell the salespeople. Here's who your targets are. Here's who you need to go. Go follow these people on LinkedIn. Go follow the firms. We're going to start running ad campaigns that we can actually go and target those individuals and those firms. So they're going to start to see our content, our ads in LinkedIn. Start to pop up more frequently. And now you start that process of engaging and building relationships.  Me: And then obviously, I'm not super knowledgeable about the space. The idea there being obviously, you know, they are the users of, for example, the I Capital platform. And so, you know, strong arming them into, you know, getting them interested in getting them excited. The delivery would have to be through our capital. And so that it makes that pitch stronger, basically, right?  Them: It makes it. Yeah. Because you kind of have to hit things from both sides in this world.  Me: Yeah, correct. In a channel partnership, for sure. Yeah. Understood. I just wanted to make sure I understood the flow correctly, but, yeah, no, I fully agree.  Them: The thing is, like, that's just one. Like, imagine everybody that's trying to sell into this channel. So everybody that's trying to sell to fund managers, because everybody that's a fund manager is registered with the SEC as most of them, or they're registered with the state. So every fundamentr is in the system, every financial advisor is in the system, some multifamily offices that aren't. Falling for an exemption are in the system. So anybody that's trying to sell into. Call it private wealth, call it the financial industry. Is in the. In the database. So any use case you can think of for how you might want to sell to them like that. What I gave you is like one example. Like it's how I would use it. If I was at a firm trying. So what we're trying to find right now is we've got. The system built. Our UX is not great. We've got our own chatbot, but we've also got, like, a connector, so you can connect it to, like, I'm using it through Perplexity right now because that tool is working. So we're looking for basically a firm that understands what's in our database and what the possibilities are to partner with. So to help us basically build. These different workflows. So a strategic partner like Pluto, for example, would have a very specific way that they'd want to attack the market. We would basically partner with them to arm the system to do that.  Me: Yeah. Ma'am.  Them: And help their salespeople basically put their sales plans together. All that targeting. The good thing is the team that I work with called Pure Math. They're the people were based in the US and in Japan. Like, we've got a pretty deep. Data science and data science engineering team, I would say so. It's like, tell us what it is that you want and we will build the workflow.  Me: Right. Yeah. I mean, I already previewed with Neil that I was going to have this chat, and he sounded, you know, he was like, yeah, that sounds awesome. But so that you know that I. I'm happy to go and set that up.  Them: That'd be awesome. Yeah.  Me: I think maybe what would be how we could probably ensure you nail that 100%. As if you did want to show me a demo or whatever you want to. You know, if you wanted to show me an experience that you've tailored to Pluto sort of from the outside. Right. I can then review it with you. And advise on, you know, what bits might really hit and might might not. And then in parallel, you can have them meeting with Neil, set up.  Them: So. Yeah. So. No, that's awesome. So what I can do? I can do a couple things. One is, so we've got. We've got two systems running right now. One. I'll call it the. The prototyping zone. And that's our MCP connector, which is model context protocol connect. Like I can run. The document that you shared with me. Basically, what I can do is build a thread that I can share the link to and you can read through. Here's the question I asked, here's the response that it gave, and I can show you. This is how it works. It needs refinement, but the idea is what we've also built. And I'll show you that too. And it's working is our chatbot is a really basic UX right now, but it's connected to the database and it actually, like, call it the production grade system. It operates much faster is basically, it just needs. We need to have some resources so that we can spend time building. Every little aspect of it, but, yeah, so I don't. Why don't I take what you gave me? I'll run a couple different threads and I'll send them to you. And then we can set up some time later this week or early next, and I can just, you know. Sit at the system and you tell me what to type in, and we can. We can run through it. It's definitely. And then at some point, because we. What we need to do.  Me: Cool.  Them: We built all of this bootstrapped. So we've been taking outside of our consulting work and, like, we're going to build this system because we know this is going to, like. Every single person I've talked to is like, if you build it. We'll use it. So we've been building it, but now we're at this stage where we're like, we need to start raising funds. So that we can ramp up. It's either raising funds or finding a strategic partner that can help fund the build. It's a fund go to market and all those things. We can't fund that out of pocket right now. So it might be a great opportunity even for what you and Matt are doing, to just discuss how you guys might be able to help because Sean is a first time CEO and so we're going through this whole process of him trying to really refine the pitch and do that, but it feels very haphazard to me right now, so.  Me: Y. Eah. Yeah. Happy? To. First time around. It always is. It's not natural thing, is it? So, yeah, that's why we. Yeah, it's why we exist. But the bar is very, very low. You would be surprised. Most people cannot adequately, from the right altitude at least, you know, articulate the various vectors of the business that people need. To hear about. Right. Like, very often it's over indexed in one area or another, depending on what they've been working on that week or, you know, whatever it is.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Cool, man. So let's do that.  Them: Yeah.  Me: I'll get with Neil. I talk with Neil next on Monday, but I'm going to shoot him a text. He's in Dubai. I think at the moment it might be, you know, 10 days. At 10 days or so until you get in front of him, but that'll give us some time.  Them: Okay? Okay? That just gives us more time to get the system.  Me: Yeah, exactly. But yeah.  Them: Polish.  Me: I'll keep you posted.  Them: Awesome.  Me: Do you use WhatsApp?  Them: I do. I haven't used it in a while because I'm just slacking with everybody.  Me: Okay, well, you use imessage, then he texts, you're a texter. Or not. Yeah, okay.  Them: Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Why don't I just send you all my contact info along with a quick follow up after this?  Me: Okay? Okay, great. Great. And then. Yeah, and then I'll just. You and I can share. And then, as I say, I'll set up the time with Nil.  Them: Yeah, it sounds awesome, man.  Me: All right, buddy, be well.  Them: I'm glad you're doing well. Thank you.  Me: Thank you. Talk soon, buddy.  Them: All right, Take care.
