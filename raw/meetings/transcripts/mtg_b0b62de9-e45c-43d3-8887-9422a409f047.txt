 Them: Good man. Happy Monday.  Me: Yeah, like quiet.  Them: So the big stuff.  Me: His notetakers here, by the way, if you don't want to.  Them: Oh, no, I'm just going to recap the stuff I chatted with him about. It's like hiring, pricing. Go to market.  Me: Yeah. I mean, there's a document here.  Them: Fundraising.  Me: Yeah, he has a document. Hang on, I'll send it to you.  Them: Okay?  Me: J. Ack. Where? Is it? But, yeah, his main one is definitely hiring. It's like product people. Checker 2026. Matt. Button. Where are you? And then, yeah, in the future, I think obviously we can tag team this call. We don't need to both be on it all the time. But just for the first couple, I thought we should be.  Them: Yeah. Are you thinking? Do you want to be point on this one and just bring me in separately or do you want me to.  Me: Yeah, I think so. I think. That makes sense. But obviously we'll see what Jack wants as well. Don't know exactly how, what he's thinking.  Them: Should I just be reposting these product roles?  Me: Yeah. I mean, look, let's talk to him, but yes.  Them: I mean, I'm assuming I'm repost them on my LinkedIn, right?  Me: Y. Eah. The product need is the is the strongest that he has currently.  Them: Okay?  Me: And I've been struggling with that one. It's a hard. He wants like cross border. He wants quite a specific set of experience which. We've talked about this before.  Them: Well, he should just have a list of companies that he wants to poach from. Versus, like, a job description.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Let's network in and steal somebody from one of these ten companies.  Me: Right. Right.  Them: See in this doc as well. Yeah.  Me: Yeah. It is.  Them: Hey, guys. Sorry. Actually, just finish a case study with Frida. We're going to have to sell her. She's going through another process with Ripple. She's shopping, but not technically looking around. So it's one of those things where it's like dating and you got to. Get her. Does she have finance or no? She wasn't finance. Yeah, she left probably six months ago now. She hated it. It doesn't have much autonomy. She has to ask the Chinese boss for everything. Well, yeah. You're working for finance. Yeah. Exactly. She came highly recommended by Avaro at Ignea, so. And then we made a couple reference calls and stuff, and so she made a really good GMT for us. Yeah, yeah. One second. I'm speaking. I'll track it down, but I'm. I'm speaking to Daniel Vogel. His car led. His assistant just reached out to me. February 5th, 3:00pm. Yes. I have it on my calendar. So this. If there's anything we need from. I mean, so I can ask him about the experience with. With Rita and. Yeah, that would be great. Do you have any idea about someone at her level with a comp? No. I mean, I, like, I can guess what it is. I mean, my guess is probably base of 200ish, 225. And then, yeah, it's like, is she coming in with a big stock grant and therefore she's taking more of, like a founder style, you know, compensation, or has she been burned by the equity stuff? And she's just looking for the highest cash offer, you know, so. Cash. Best clinician. Some nominal equity. Yeah.  Me: Well, I don't know. I don't know if it's nominal, but, like, I mean, for G. What's the roll, Jack? It's like a GM of where.  Them: Got it. Okay. Mexico. She would be our first higher attempt.  Me: Yeah.  Them: So, I mean, title wise, like, I'm happy to give her a title, inflation and whatever, but effectively, it's more than Mexico, so.  Me: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know as well, Jack, if you remember, from, from before, but one of the things that we would recommend on this side is that you give sort of, you know, multiple flavors of an offer. I mean, obviously, this is, you know, let's get there first. Right. But like, you, you would give like a High equity. High equity, low cash.  Them: Yeah. Yep.  Me: High cash, low equity, and then medium, medium. So that, like, it kind of eliminates the ability to really, really negotiate anyway, because you've kind of given all the options, right?  Them: Yes. Yep. Okay, cool. Yeah, when. When it comes to that. I may need to help Matt. To sell. To sell freedom. Oh, of course. Anytime.  Me: So how do you. Where do you want to start, Jack? I mean, we were just. While we were waiting, we were kind of Matt and I synced up on what we understand, sort of the focus is to be. We've got the document up, you know, the 2026 plans with, you know, what we understand is. Hiring is still the major thing. Right, but why don't you talk us through, and then we can. We can figure out what we want to do. Sort of in the immediate term between us.  Them: Yeah. So should we dig deep into the hiring?  Me: Yes.  Them: Yeah, so.  Me: Stop wherever you want. But, like our understanding is that's the number one.  Them: Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So pm for sure. Yes, of course. Port of payments product manager. So we were talking about this. This is quite specific, right? Yeah, it is. Can we get a list of companies that you would want to see this person work from? Yeah, yeah, I have a list. Let me tag me here and I'll. And I'll paste it.  Me: Because I thought was Jack, that we'll probably have to do a bit of sort of selling amongst our networks to try to get to some of these people that we might want to sort of sell Checker to, you know?  Them: So. There is. There is? Yeah. We're doing second chats with folks from Wise and Ebanks and. So. But. But, yeah, I will paste it here. Yeah, there. There is a bit of selling here. But there's a lot of scenarios where, like, depends on the seniority that we hire. So, yeah, I'll just. I'll. I'll actually paste it now.  Me: You can just dump them somewhere else and we'll figure it out. You don't need to make it look nice.  Them: Okay? So. That's product manager, software engineer. So this one is. Yeah. So, look, I think the way the. The staffing, the way is going to work is. We generally prefer to have a cross border payments manager who has the expertise and then to have engineers and a group of jack of all trades. Without the sector expertise of the technical expertise. But then, just for you know, The other scenario is, let's say we get a prompt manager that's less knowledgeable about cross border management across product payments, but then we have software engineer who's been there. So it's sort of they, they come from each other. So that's. That's a software engineer. High. That's specifically for payments.  Me: Okay?  Them: Market leads. So, yeah, Spanish, speaking Latin. And then this is opportunistic, potentially cover Brazil. We are as part of this hiring role. We're actually talking to candidates who might. Who sometimes are Brazilians, and they might actually be better off covering Brazil than so much speaking latam, so. As many candidates as possible.  Me: So. So on that. You don't have a. I mean, obviously, if they're Brazilian and they might not be, would they need to be spat? They need to be Spanish speaking anyway, right?  Them: Yeah, they do. Yeah. Yeah. For this yet. But look, if. If you come across a really good talent for Brazil. They're strong that they're spiky in Brazil. Then, yeah, we can. We can chat as well because we have a good web browser. We get. We now browsers compare it to Genio. We're on track to sign two more competitors. A browser. Ootey and Regimento. We obviously have bits of business that's. That's turning up.  Me: Okay?  Them: So we need someone in Brazil. There's a repeatable goods market. There.  Me: Why Company list. By the way, where did you. Oh, no. I see. I see it here now. Yeah, I see it.  Them: Y. Eah, yeah. It's all right. And then for Africa, Africa will be also like a GM sales role will be for as long as they're based in one of the three major economies that sat fine. So Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa. We prefer someone spiky in Nigeria, Kenya rather than South Africa generally. South Africa used to be pretty insulated market from the rest. And then this one we have. We have a couple candidates in second. Yeah, second chats and case. Case studies. Yeah. So that's. That's where we're at.  Me: That's for the. The Africa one, right? Or the.  Them: That's the Africa one.  Me: Okay? Cool. Understood? And then you marketing as a sort of lower priority than, for example, one of these market leads. Is that accurate?  Them: Correct. It is, it is accurate. So what's happening in marketing is. I'm also talking to some marketing agencies, right? So folks who've bought like HCS that's worked in cross border payments or robot assets or the more real style of crypto. So potentially, it's possible that we just outsource it to someone to handle it. The most immediate deliverable right now is to fundraise pr, which we'll on track. I'm working with Galaxy PR and that. There's a couple. There's quite a lot of that I'm fixing. We're doing a launch video as well. With another agency. So frankly, I'm just overwhelmed then. Like, I'm switching a lot of context when I do marketing stuff, and I'm way behind.  Me: So there's absolute. Should that not be a higher priority? Like, I. I know these are all high priorities. Anyway, it doesn't really matter, right? But I feel like. I feel like this one is. I mean, should we have a chat? I mean, matt. I know that we. I mean.  Them: So the first question, Jack, is as you're triaging this, what has an insane amount of work, right? Like, you currently have 80 hours of week for this person. And, like, if they started like, you would. They would not be bored. For six to nine months. It sounds like that's sort of the product side. We have, like, a lot. 100. Yeah. PM row. Yeah, 100%. And then the second is what things do. I need capable people to execute, but there's just like, a body of work, and it's probably like, you know. Three months worth of work or six months worth of work. And then like once they get all that done, like there. There might not be like sort of ongoing because we need a triage for you on, like, again. The more full time hires we add, they're gonna. A lot of them will want to report to you. Right. And then that slows you down because now you're, like, managing people in addition to trying to, like, get stuff done. So it's like we don't. Or maybe the product manager won't report to you. Right. So that's actually a good first question, but somebody like marketing probably would, and. Like, do we want just like a contractor that can just knock this shit out, or do we, you know, and. And order? Do we want somebody full time that we have to sort of. Yeah, this is. Yeah, I. I think it's probably a contractor. Yeah, contractor or, or agency. I'm flexible. I'm optimizing. For quick fix like contract is probably pretty cheap.  Me: Right.  Them: Again. Someone to just do the work.  Me: And when we say do the work on marketing, it sounds like, obviously there's the reactive stuff around, you know, just catching up. Right. But then, like, what else? What else needs to be done?  Them: Yes. I think, I mean, look, I think ideally, if there's a contractor agencies that also does the higher level, like ideation, messaging, refining that, that takes off, that takes off, that takes work off my plate. So my brain has, you know, I don't need to overload on those stuff. I want to offload that. And if we find someone who's just execution, then I need to do those, and then I just tell them. Hey, you know, like, write these things, queue these things up. And, you know, here's a list. Go do it.  Me: Wonder if Nadia's still busy, Matt.  Them: She's just mostly doing ad tech stuff right now, I think.  Me: Okay?  Them: Yeah, the last time I chatted with her. But yeah, I mean, look, we know these people. Like, we can start to ask around. Are you the one who is doing the job description? Jack. Yeah. Yeah, I can. I can put it up pretty. Let me make it happen today. I got it. Okay? Sales. Yeah, sales is we, yeah, so we, we actually, we actually have, I think we have good coverage of leads and conversations and stuff. We have very low conversion rate, like converting into closing, converting to usage. That's the problem we have. I think the diagnosis is a couple things. And number one is we are not selling much, like our product is not selling much. If you break it down, it's a chat bot that enables trading. So obviously, as we, as we launch new products and our roadmap, that's going to solve part of it. It's going to make it more, let's say, offering more appealing. So on this, though, like, if you could only fix one thing in the sales process. You know, is it, like, top of funnel? We're not, like, talking with the right people. Is it, like, closing? We're not getting these people to sign contracts or that activation. Like, we've already signed the contract, but we just need people to, like, actually onboard and implement. I think it's closing, and I think part of that closing is. To align Checker to a concrete. Commercial milestone. Like we can help our customers make more money. Bottom line, if we can make it happen across each of the customers and I think we can close. And then our customers will also have also put in the time. To actually activate and and use us. So that has an in other words, we have not been able to. Make more money for our customers. 80% of the time. And this is because they don't know how to use the product, or the product just doesn't bring them value, or that doesn't bring them value. Okay. Is there, like, do you think that that's fixed if we're having this conversation in six months, that the product will be fixed? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so. Okay. And then so back to the closing piece, right? Do you think that the issue is? Is that we're, like, asking them to do a lot of work and they don't want to do the work. Do you think the issue is, is that, like, they don't know who our other clients are, and they don't feel like this is, like, you know. They don't want to be the guinea pig. They don't want to be the first ones to sort of sign up. Or do you think we have a competitor? And they're thinking about going with an alternate solution. So it's non competitor. We don't in sales conversations, no competitors come up. Our biggest competitor, Status quo. They just. Customers just keep doing their thing. They don't want to change. Yes, there's an element of guinea pig. I think having case studies and more marketing can solve it. Okay, well, let's. Let's make that the top level thing. We need case studies. On marketing. And then I think, It's our offering. Is not 10x better than the status quo? So there's a switching inertia. Good salespeople you can sell into. Just they need to believe that it will be 10x someday. It doesn't necessarily be today.  Me: And jack. I guess. Then what would be what? What has enabled us to get our deals done? Currently with guys that we have that are happy. If some other times the product experience is a little bit, like, underwhelming, like, like, was that just a force of personality that Mike or you or, you know, whoever managed to push through to get done?  Them: Yeah. So. Yeah. So if I reframe your question is, what has made it work? Right? What are the elements that. Has made success.  Me: Yeah, I guess. Like, if you're saying that the. The product is kind of what it is, which I understand, I get that. But then, nevertheless, we do have folks who are really happy, right? So, like, what can we represent?  Them: Yeah. I think there's definitely Founder Less ell's personality driven, that's for sure. I think that that helps with. That helps with moving deals alone, like to to the closing and then with activation. And usage as well. And I think the other one is more circumstantial, right? It's like, I think the best deals that we've done. Where we find, where we resonate with customers very well is they have an actual pain right now and then what? And they want to solve yesterday like, like their existing providers break down. Or they need xyz capabilities by now. So usually in sales process, we qualify for that. Right. Which also. Which, you know, obviously means it's smaller bucket. But if. If a customer shows those traits and they say those things and they're real. I'm not concerned about us closing them and increasing usage.  Me: Yeah, but so then. Then that's. I mean. You know, you can't be everything to everyone. If you're trying to sell to folks that, like, don't have the problem yet, then that's probably more of a targeting and kind of, you know, sort of qualification and time investment thing than anything else, right?  Them: Yeah, I think so. I think. Look, I think the other part of me. Is the high order objective for sales is, yes, revenue. I think if we optimize what revenue we need to go after people with actual pain in which it's. It's a numbers game and. And then maybe as a product launch, as we have new products. The scope. Of our immediate addressable customers grow. But then on the other hand, is I also want to get big logos, right? So sometimes the big logos, they don't. It's a complicated. If we actually try to qualify them by actual pain and all this stuff. But there. So I also want us to just find the lowest hanging fruit, like however small that get us to claim. That this logo is the customer of ours.  Me: Yeah. Okay?  Them: And we have not been able to do that yet.  Me: Yeah, I understand. And so that goes into your second. There's a point in here about logos, isn't there? Like in. Yeah. Here you say you just want big logos of referenceable customers. That is anchoring towards. I mean, if we go into. I don't. What I don't see on here at all is fundraising stuff. Right. And to my mind what you're talking about. There is more of a, you know, it helps to close other guys. Right. If you can say, oh, by the way, we've got a really nice sexy logo here, I get that. But if they're not going to be revenue generative, you know, massively accretive to the bottom line in the first instance. It must be because we. We like the sexy logo, which to my mind is, you know, supportive. More of an ingredient into a fundraising process at some point. Right. I see down here that we, you know, you also have. I'm just. I'm interested in this new so ARR. Annualized run rate revenue, which is. This is a fun one. We'll have to talk about that because I feel like. I feel like you need to not. This is going to confuse people, but anyway.  Them: That's right.  Me: You know, I see that we have actual kind of revenue sort of growth targets in here, too. And, you know, you know, so we're kind of running both of those stories in parallel. Fundamental bottom line business growth plus the sexy cut and icing on top. But like, yeah, how does this play into the fundraising narrative in your mind.  Them: I think. Currently we don't have to grow. To be a sexy company, right? So we need. That metric growth, whatever that metric is. And to be more intellectually honest. Hence, I pick revenue because investors don't disagree. On. You know, they usually think revenue is a good metric versus tpv. Some. Some investments might be more skeptical about that. So I'm trying to find the lowest denominator.  Me: Yeah. And then? And then did you make up? So the annualized run rate revenue, where is that? I've not seen that metric before with the three R's like that. Did you? Is that your own creation? Like, if you just mean.  Them: No, I think. Look, I think I'm just. I'm just. It doesn't matter what's a call. I. You know. You know, I'm firm.  Me: If you just. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. I just want to make sure, though, because. Because people do. People do make up their own.  Them: Right. It's just run rate. It's a run rate revenue.  Me: You understood. People do make up their own definitions of revenue, so I just wanted to make sure.  Them: Right.  Me: Okay?  Them: Yeah, just. Just because we use revenue doesn't mean that there's not going to be a lot of arguments about what that means at the end of the. Yeah, exactly. Hence, you know, the galaxy, you know, that polygon subsidy. You know, we're not, you know, we're not getting that renewal, so, like. In the next or like has been tracking so.  Me: Yeah, exactly. Well, that's.  Them: Yeah. So, like, in the future, like, we don't. We don't foresee the blockchain subsidies to be. To grow as a portion of our revenue.  Me: So you're saying that Jack. So, like, you know. With regards to the fundraising narrative, like your perception is that the momentum, you know, the growth in whatever flavor of growth we decide to create, Is today not in a place I don't think we need to go and race tomorrow now again anyway. But. But what does that look like through the year for you then? Like, when do you think we need to be, you know, based on. What, you know, what you think. When, when would we want to be like, approaching some kind of momentum story that we would take to the market?  Them: Yeah. So, look, I think the faster we hire, the faster. The faster we get this done, the best we're in in a good position. Actually, I don't think end of March will be feasible. I think property like probably may given some ramp up time. I think the sales will help us a lot. The new product launch will help us a lot. I think. Yeah, I think from. If you look at revenue is coming from all the way to usage, and as we fix each part of that journey, then I think we're in good position to hit this growth. I think we have the ingredients, but for whatever reason we're, you know, we're baking the kick in a wrong way or we have we put it in the oven at a wrong temperature? Whatever it is.  Me: And so there's no economic need. You know, what will our burn go to once we start to, like, you know, spend some money on growth and stuff?  Them: So I think it will be, I think right now. So right now we're at. Devon. Eight when I would eight people. And it will be around, I think. Yeah. Two mil, two more burn. So we have two years of Runway. It's pretty conservative. So the raise is not driven by Runway concern. It's driven by momentum, and we just. We just got to grow. Yeah. Yeah.  Me: Okay? So basically, it's in our court to. To, you know, to create that story when. When we think we need to.  Them: Correct? Yeah.  Me: Okay?  Them: Yeah. I mean. My guess, just based on our conversation, Jack, on just, like, the concentration of our customers, et Storey I think it's going to take us a couple months to, like, sort of just focus on operational excellence and, like, getting us down. The thing from this conversation. I think we should spend more time on is just, you know, I think there's one level which is like, let's sell to the people that will instantly find value. In our product and upgrade our product so that more people find value. But for the logos. I don't know if I would be chasing big logos right now. Like, I would probably put that on a back burner because. We want them because of the, like, marketing value of that. But again, they're not our ideal customer profile today. And if we don't think that they're going to see high value of the product, then it's like we're going to expend a lot of energy and resources that could potentially be used elsewhere. Now, where I think you do want the logos is like, right before we raise.  Me: All. Right.  Them: Like in the middle of our raise process to be like, yeah, we just signed Bridge and we just signed PayPal or we just signed or whoever it is. Right. Like, you know, and again, I think we can do that. Right. Especially if we have more customers. Right. I think we've talked about your business is like the more customers, the more like desirable it is for people to work with you. When you're a limited number of customers, it's harder. Are there any US Banks that are trading these like Brazos? Yeah, we're talking to a few. So aaronbor who working out a deal with Aaronborn going to be friends with the we have those internal strategy to be friends of the admin. We're doing similarly for Anchorage and usat. That's why I was in I was in El Salvador last week. Next. N3XT. The X server gate. Guys. Yeah. So where Justin is our in house banker, so to speak. But it's. It's pretty slow. And because the US we have to shift our focus a little bit. It's not a wins for impeachment browser. The us banks are not trading directly. And it's also like smaller banks, right? It's not like. It's not like a JP Morgan or Citibank or whatever. It's more of the crypto friendly banks, the new types of Silver Gate insulator. That that we're targeting.  Me: Are you close with? Is there. Is there anything real going on with any of them? I get you close to getting anything done with any of them.  Them: Yeah, yeah, just. Just opening bank accounts. Not. They don't. They're not. They're not a customer, per se.  Me: Okay?  Them: Which kind of work up some two way deals where we sent them customers to open bank accounts and then they use us one way or another. Ashley, do you know what? Oh, yeah, Actually, I'm going to need your back channel to call him. Let me drop. Jeremy Brenner. He's a product manager, Column. He's running this stablecoin product. They want to. Column wants to offer stablecoin deposit withdrawal. Sorry. Not. Not chairing me. Wrong guy. All right, Jack, I got a jump. I had a little overlap between double sharp and you, but starting next week, I'll fix this so this doesn't happen to digging in on this. Thank you. I'll keep going. Bye.  Me: So we run. We have a Granola on this. So all the. All the to dos will just get. You know, we'll just get sent. So don't worry about that. Yeah, column is easy. Because we know Will. Hockey. Who's the founder of Plaid?  Them: Yeah, one of the owners of Plaid.  Me: Yeah, exactly. Okay? What else, jack? I mean, I think basically what I was. What I was sort of hearing there is. And I think I agree with Burton, but I don't think that it needs to be a sort of major, you know, like, maybe just for the next, like, I don't know, two months or three months or two months maybe, or. Something. You know, from a sales perspective, your time investment is mostly on guys that have the urgent need that can convert quickly and start using. And then maybe, you know, sort of, you know, I don't know, end of March, April again. Is when you start to revisit, you know, maybe by that point as well, with a little bit more product progress, can revisit some of the large enterprise logo conversations with a view to then, you know, signing one of those maybe two months after that, which, you know, might be when we're in market for asking for some more money. Maybe over the summer. Right, so. I. I agree. I agree with burton. If you've got nothing to talk about with them, then there's very little value in sort of spending a bunch of time getting the logo up. So again, if you can do it quickly or easily. Right. Then fine. Right. But I think it's more about. Well, our feedback, I think is more about from a time investment perspective. Because to your point, like, it's like, we don't have the growth right now to be a sexy business. So we have to optimize for in the immediate term where the growth is going to come. And if you're saying to us that the big enterprise stuff that companies that folks will know about like that's a little bit of a longer play, then obviously that doesn't make sense, does it?  Them: Yeah, yeah, for sure. We're going to do both. But. Yeah, look, I think I want to be in a position similar to bridge pre acquisition, right? Like they have a bunch of big logos that don't really do much volume, like all the US State Department, Starlink and USAID and all that.  Me: Y. Eah.  Them: It's graceful to be in.  Me: Plus, though, they did. They, you know, they. They did have. Actual sort of underlying usage as well. Right. Like, so. So, to your point, I'm not saying that we don't, but I'm just saying, like, yes, we should do both, but my bias would be like, 80, 20, like, you know, short deal cycles to longer ones. And then I guess, on. On the hiring roles. What is the goal for timing? Like, when. When do we. And, you know, obviously, I know it's sort of yesterday, but internally, at least among all of you yourselves and like, for us, when do these people need to be in by? Like, as soon as possible. Right. I'm guessing.  Them: Yeah, for all the sales and PM as soon as possible. PM is like yesterday. P. M. Is actually yesterday.  Me: Yeah, yeah.  Them: Because we are making some over promises right now.  Me: Okay? Okay? Okay? Is there anything else you need from me? I mean, where are we on? Are we sending out investor updates? You know. Do you want us to get back in on those drafting those for you? Like. You know what else?  Them: Yeah. Look, I think to prospective investors. I personally don't see much. So between now and fundraise pr, I don't see much value in writing out new investor. Update to perspective. To existing investors. Yeah, we can. We can keep that up. There's no problem. I think existing investors. Right now, I'm prioritizing asks. Like, here's the asks. And you know, I'm not prioritizing selling Checker anymore. At least in the next one or two months. We need to stay relevant, which I think the fundraise PR is going to stay relevant. I think worst case is we can do PR at the, @ the end of the month. So that's. That's the timeline.  Me: Did you do, like, in, like, summary? Did you do, like a 2025 look back?  Them: Yeah. Yeah, I think you're on the list. Yeah, I sent one out for existing investors, not for prospective.  Me: Okay? That might be the only thing. I mean, look again, like, use us, right? Like, this doesn't have to take up any of your time. I worry about us going completely dark just because people forget very quickly. If you have short term memories.  Them: Yeah, yeah.  Me: I agree with you that we don't need to be like we. We don't need to be selling ourselves in those things, because that's not the motion that we're in at the moment. I agree with that. But I disagree. I think probably that we should go dark. I'm happy for us to go dark for a month or two. Whatever. That's fine. I think the pr, the launch PR is valid, as you say. That will keep us on people's radars. And then I think maybe if you. If you did. Want to do a 2025 look back for the broader commute investment community. You know, you could then maybe say, like, we'll be back in April with our first update for the year, but we're heads down until then or something like that, right? So just use us for it, like, tell me, you know. Ask me to write it for you, and I can take the existing one and change it a little bit. But I worry about them completely dark. That's my only point.  Them: Okay, so in that case, I'm gonna drop the investor update I sent two weeks ago to existing investors. I'm gonna drop that to you. You can take a look.  Me: Great.  Them: We do have one good data for prospective, which. Is we did a billion accumulated volume in the first six months, and then we'd hit our second billion two weeks ago. Which took us three months to hit a second billion.  Me: Yeah, see, that's great. And so, like, you know, we, we, we want to Elliot to that a little bit. Right? Like, even though we're not selling. And the other thing is, you forget that the investors, they could actually be helpful with hiring as well. Like, I think it would, it would benefit us if more people knew about our hiring needs. Right. And so, again, you know, if we can, if we can lead in that 20, 25 look back, you know, we, we do some really, you know, sort of sexy metrics about all the momentum and that. And then we say, oh, by the way, we're now growing the team. Like, please send all talent out away. We're looking for product people, et Storey You know, who knows? You send it out to 200 people, maybe you get two responses, right? Which is two more than two more than we have today.  Them: Yeah. Exactly.  Me: Okay, So I can take care of that. Okay. I think. I think that's. I think that's good, right?  Them: Yeah, that's great. So from hiring. So, yeah, you guys have that? Matt, can you guys have that for sales? How hands on Will you guys be like, do we have a. Is it. Do we make a sheet? An Excel sheet? We're using HubSpot.  Me: Yeah. Yes, for sure. I mean, I think you must have. What's your latest CRM these days that you're using?  Them: We're installing HubSpot right now. We're setting it up.  Me: Okay? If that is going to be done, you know, in the next couple days, I would suggest we just wait and we can just pull out of HubSpot and then. And then, yes, that will constitute the sort of source of truth for, you know, where we want to push on big logos or customers or anything like that.  Them: Yeah.  Me: If not, then we can just start a sheet. But, like, I'm assuming it will be done soon, right?  Them: 100%. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.  Me: Yeah. So let's just do that. You can permission me into HubSpot even, and I can just, you know, we. We can move out of Google sheets finally. And then, you know, we can either have that as a separate track, like me and you. You can just sync for 15, 20 minutes separately, some point in the week on any BD stuff, or I think for now we'll just keep it. You know, let's keep it as is until the work becomes so you. Know until we need to do that, but we can also do that if we need to. All right, buddy. And so, yeah, I'm hiring. Sorry, Jack. What are you going to say?  Them: Okay? No, go ahead.  Me: No, I was going to say so on hiring, we've got the stuff. But, like, in terms of the actions, like, I'll let Granola output the, you know, the summary for me. But, like, yeah, it'll just be me and Burton, like, socializing and pushing. And as I say, based on this customer, based on this company list here. You know, it will be a bit more targeted in terms of our strategy for who to, you know, as opposed to just like, pinging the job description out kind of passively. Like, we'll actually look into some of these companies and who do we know there and, you know, that kind of stuff.  Them: Yep. Cool.  Me: All right, buddy.  Them: I'm dropping. So I. I dropped the investor update. If we can take a look and see, edit that full perspective and then we'll call them. I'm giving you more context. Would be great to if you can ping Jason or Will directly.  Me: Y. Ep. Yeah, we know. Matt's been in touch with Will there recently. Anyway, so that one's all good.  Them: I'm going to give you the context. Okay? Cool. Okay. Amazing.  Me: All right, buddy, we'll talk soon.  Them: Cheers. Thanks, Elliot.  Me: Bye.
