 Them: Sorry, Elliot. One second. I've decided to turn into a national logistics center for my girlfriend, by the looks of it.  Me: It's always the way when you're on a call, you work from home. Deliveries and such.  Them: Give me one sec. Right, I'm back. Elliot. Good job. That wasn't a client call, so apologies.  Me: I'm going to have to do. I've got a delivery coming in about 25 minutes myself, so I'll have to do the same for a minute or two.  Them: No worries. Let me give you a background into myself, and then obviously my career. Then obviously vice versa would be great.  Me: Vice. Versa.  Them: So, yeah, I caveat this in every single time I do this. With that. One of the things that I was very lucky was to grow up with a father who was a successful entrepreneur. So he exited multiple businesses for eight figures. He also went bankrupt as well. Totally different industry. Greeting cards, Happy birthday cards. But the reason for me why I mentioned that is I had a very unique opportunity to grow up with a father who led businesses from zero to multimillion dollars.  Me: Opportun. Ity. Business. Es, for example. Multimillion dol. Lars.  Them: From a sales and commercial perspective. So he was 100% owner, CEO, founder, but he led his businesses from a sales perspective and commercial. And that's kind of really why I ended up where I was. I saw the highs, the lows, the pitfalls, and kind of what it takes to go from early stage to ultimately profitable and exitable, but also what it takes to go bankrupt. Right. So just for context, and this comes kind of later down the line, and why we're building Dolfinai is that I actually saw one of his businesses about five years ago, which turned over 35 million and made 2 million, go bankrupt because of cash. Flow issues and issues from a macroeconomic and a finops perspective.  Me: Business. Es from. Also. Context. And this comes. From. Another. Perspect. Ive.  Them: So having said that, everything I did in my career was intentional, and even my university degree of business was intentional, because ultimately, entrepreneurial journey for me was never a question of if, but when. So after I left uni, I went into Accenture in quite a unique team, actually. It was called Ecosystem Adventures. We basically took minority stakes in RPA businesses at the time, like UiPath, Blue Prison and resold them into investment banks or retail banks. It was a super niche team that's 35 people globally. I was there for about two years. I got promoted very quickly. I got promoted in nine months. But ultimately I wanted to work in Big Corp. It was just more of a stepping stone to move to London for me. At that point. I then went out into the startup world a little bit naively somewhat and joined a precede startup which I will say I would never recommend to anyone unless it's their own business. I was there for about nine months. It was in the end.  Me: Or unless it's yours, right, James?  Them: Unless it's your own business. Yeah, right. Was there for nine months. Seven of those nine months I didn't get paid. It was £25,000, cash and debt. Living in center of London, trying to pay rent, which was not fun. I knew the guys at Currency Cloud from when I worked at Accenture in. The Fintech Innovation Lab. So I joined them as like a business development consultant, specifically in fintech SaaS vertical. I was actually only there for about six months before I moved to Fidel where obviously I met Ryan. I was the first commercial hire there was there from Seed to Series B. Obviously a super cool journey. I know, you know, the majority of that journey as well. I'll probably have heard from Dev Ryan or anyone else. Obviously lucky to meet lots of people along the way. Super exciting one. And then after that I went to Divide later again. White Label API. Everything I've done in my career after Accenture was White Label. API.  Me: Six. Months before.  Them: They were basically selling into retail banks, into also retailers as well to offer white label buy now, pay later. I was there for a year and I almost start my own business then. But for me, starting a business is all about having the conviction, the product that you want to build, also about timing and also the market timing. As well, not just personally, for myself. So after divido I joined Manai. I don't know how much you know about them, but API infrastructure layer for invoicing and bill pay. I was employee number 8, 0 revenue. As a board observer on the senior leadership team, I grew the business from 0 to 4 million ARR to the exit. I personally contributed over 85, 90% of that revenue. I hired the team around me. US, UK, Europe, spoke to kind of over probably 2 1/2 thousand platforms about kind of finops workflows and what it takes to deliver meaningful products for these SMBs. So I guess that's where we got to. Where I'm today, I think. Yeah. Hopefully that's helpful. I can obviously go into Dolfinai and why the space and why now, but would love to kind of answer any questions or kind of hear from yourself.  Me: Very helpful. Thank you. I've been throwing what you've said sort of against the deck, that I have to try to sort of claw myself up to speed as quickly as possible. Help me understand. Okay, how about this? Before we get into all that, I'll do the same quick whistle stop tour of my side, and then we can get into it, if you like. So Elliot story. Run Backbone with my partner Matt Burton, who's in the U.S. he's a new.  Them: Yeah.  Me: You've met matt. Okay, great.  Them: Yeah, in that ages ago, Fidel.  Me: Nice. Okay, good. Yeah. He was in the Fidel Board? I think so. Matt and I have known each other for our whole careers. Best part of 15 years. We both started in ad tech. At a little company for both of us. Pretty much straight out of college. Ended up a couple of years later being bought by Google. So that really was a springboard for us and our careers. It was sort of a strong core of folks from that initial cohort that have really kind of stuck together and gone on to do good things. So as I say, we solved that business to Google. Both of us are pretty junior there. So I'll leave it to you to figure out what roles we played there. But as we grew up, we went through more exits in the uk. I was part of one. Sold to Tesco and ad tech company to Tesco. Matt had one in the US that ended up being sold to Facebook. We reteamed up in New York in2015. He was the founder of Orchard, which at the time. Was the darling of the fintech world really before fintech were just as fintech really I suppose was getting that label was a platform that kind of sat in between. It was the first kind of orchestration, aggregation type access plane for institutional investors and for non bank lenders. That business also had some ups and downs, sort of. We learned a lot there. Similar to. The value of what you would say your dad brought you in terms of we have some really good learnings and some really tough ones as well, let's say. Ended up exiting that business to another small business lender to a small business lender in the US Called Cabbage. Most recently was sold up into Amex. So some of that ip is sort of.  Them: Yeah.  Me: And then Matt went to the dark side after that, so we lost it.  Them: He went vc, didn't he?  Me: Yeah, he went to go and become an investor. I stuck around QED. So I'd been around QED's portfolio as an operator and had gotten to know them as an investor sort of through that. And they placed me at another QED company. Similar to your journey with Fidel, really, like, very early and then left much later on. And rejoined Burton up, as I say, about 15, 16 months ago now, maybe a bit longer to start Backbone. And really. What Backbone is or was in its first iteration, I think, and will always be. But where it started from was an outgrowth from really what we'd seen in our operator careers thus far, which was just know essentially as it related to the role of the CEO or the founders, the venture model. Was creaking broken misalignment of incentives. Sort of strange, curious business models. And altogether a model as well on the venture side, which did not really. In our view, create a rosy future for being able to bring in the best sort of talent there misalignment of incentives around fund structures and how people get paid and such. We were just looking at this and saying there has to be a better way. And so what Backbone is. We essentially are your independent board members. From day one. Acting very much in that way without you having. You may not have a board. It's not about sitting on the board more. The function and the role that we play is as sort of intellectual sparring partners, coaches, sharing experience, sometimes therapists, all those things in between, but really the execution. Arm of what we offer provide together with the strategic really is anchored around ensuring that every time you go out to market to fundraise. As the CEO and as the founding team, that you come out of that experience with the best possible result for yourself, which. Is a given because it doesn't come naturally to a lot of people. I think for you, you'll be better than the average, given that the sales background. But I can assure you, you can imagine going in to talk to two very highly technical co founders about the mechanics of fundraising and really.  Them: Yeah, for sure. For sure.  Me: How it manifests itself. So the team, there's me and Matt. I'm in the uk. Operating sort of half on Eastern time, half on UK time. Have a small book of stuff over here. Ryan is one example. Matt is in new york. I would say the portfolio, business wise. Is probably about 80, 20 New York, or maybe about 70, 30 New York to other places, of which most of the other places would be sort of managed out of London. So we have a bunch of stuff in latam, but that would get managed out in New York. And we have two other partners we call sort of fractional partners who you can consider as being on the team if and when there are resources that we need to bring to bear. One is another XQED CEO actually called Justin Gilder, who. Was the CEO of a company called Reserve Trust at qed, which was the only company to have a fintech, at least to have a bed, which is pretty cool. So he's also a lawyer? He's a lawyer by trade, but he's like a business oriented, super smart. And the other guy is called. Alex Pedraza. Who? He's Colombian. He does a lot of our latam stuff. He. Most formerly. Most recently, actually, at Cap Chase, which is a company that you may know. How the work manifests itself. Know we anchor very much around the funding ground in terms of the work that we do with you. But of course, as you know, You can't just put lipstick on a pig. By which what I mean is to say, to be clear, you can't just show up three or four weeks before the round and say, hi, guys, here's the business, here's the deck. Like, go create some magic, right? The success of the funding round is. Really contingent on a bunch of the work that happens in between that. Right? Yeah. An analogy like anything, I suppose. Right? It's like the 100 meter Olympics final. Sprint final isn't one then, is it? It's one in the four years of planning in between then. The deliverables, if you like, that we work with you on in order to maximize your probability of success with the fundraising round, are directly correlated to the things that an investor would expect to see. During that funding round. Right. So like in most basic form, for your first funding round that you're doing now, your precede, seed, whatever you want to call it, the names aren't important. But that first bit of money into the business from an institution's perspective, let's leave angels aside from an institution's. Perspective. There's a few things they're going to want to see right at the minute. At this early stage, it's a little bit malleable because you could, in theory, just show up with nothing and someone could just give you a bunch of money because they'll index heavily on premetrics. They could just fall in love with you. But on average, they're going to need to see some basic version of a product, some basic version of some customers, some basic version of a 12, 18 month story and a 5 year. All these basic things, right? So then we work backwards from there, and then we say, well, how? Do we get all those things right? So customers, how do we do that? So I work with you on a customer pipeline type process. Again, given that that's. Your cultural training. I double click to say, we don't need that. Right. But I'm just sort of giving you, like, a menu of kind of how things. How we work. On the financial modeling side of things, right? Like, we need to get a basic model up. You get it, right? And then as it relates to. The kind of the tactical elements of how these things get rolled out. And I think this was a sort of alluding a little bit to what I texted with you yesterday around. And again, as a salesperson, you'll understand this. There's a sort of a logical phasing where if we start from, we want to raise X million amount of dollars by this time. And, okay, working backwards from there. And we say, all right, we roughly want the round to be of this sort of composition, meaning roughly, we've got. We want to target, we want to find one lead fund that we like that has this sorts of characteristics. You say, well, Given that these interactions are, by their very nature. Highly imbalanced from a leverage perspective, because whatever way you skin the cat, Unless you really are Sam Altman or someone, you can't really show up and just ask for money. And it'd be normal, right? There's a power dynamic there where you have very little leverage organically. So we need to manufacture that. And so, of course, we would only go to the guy that we really want the money from. When we have all the possible leverage that we've manufactured. Which would have to involve optionality, signaling massive pipeline, appearing indecisive about which option to take from the investment community because they're also good. All these various things. Right. So I'd say just. I'll pause now, but just to sort of. Try to give you a quick layer of the land there. The two vertices, if you like, or the two axes, if you like. There's a bunch of tactical stuff that happens. In terms of actual work that gets, you know, delivered right, like, hands on keyboards stuff. And then there's the strategic elements, which I think overall are really the more valuable pieces for you, which is the weekly discussions that we have that focus around the finer points of the things as I was talking about. And the final point, I'll say, and then I'll pull up back to my original framing. Of this is independent board member. That's sort of the mode of interaction that you would. You would get. Right. It's advice. It's objective. We have a horse in the race. In some ways, but we're also not in the organization, so politics is not relevant to us. It's an air gapped sparring partner, hitting partner like sounding board type function.  Them: Okay? Okay? Makes sense. Makes sense. Where do I start? A lot of what you have again. Kind of what I said from my career thus far. It was all on purpose. I've done pre seed. I've done seed. I've done abcde. The reason timing was right for me is because I've seen the exposure across all of those stages. Right. So I've seen what you need at precede to be successful. C series. A, B, C, D, E. So there's. That was why I took the time to start my own business. If I'm honest, Elliot, like, one of the things that when I left university was, I'm gonna go start my own business. I feel like you absolutely need the experience. And the exposure over the years to get to the position where you know how to do these things. And that's why I confidently feel like that time is now, if that makes sense.  Me: You. See series a, b. Cd.  Them: So that's hopefully just gonna give you some context of why I did the journeys that I did. It was very much on purpose, as opposed to just a cool new company here, if that makes sense. So I mean to give you a letter. Land. We've signed clients. We've contracted ARR. We have over half a million in pipeline.  Me: What are you not good at? I get the feeling from you. I like how you speak like you sound competent. As a former salesperson myself, I can identify a decent salesperson from a rubbish salesperson, let me put it that way. What are you not good at?  Them: Obviously, everyone has their failings. There's things that people aren't strong at. Right. So we have two commercial founders. So that gives you your first insight. Right. We don't have any technical founders. We have built a team of advisors around us, such as Dan Osborne, his chief payments officer at Payhawk. It was VP of Engineering at Marketa Employee 36.  Me: Office. R. Grove. On.  Them: Richard dayton because he's svp of big data at fis and did an AI masters about 15, 20 years ago. We've built a prototype platform because I think you'll agree now, right, the difference between a commercial founders versus tech founders. The gap has narrowed. A prototype which we successfully sold. Yes, it's based on AI and using tooling, but the first thing we're going to have to do is hire a founding engineer to scale this, I think.  Me: What did you build it in? How did.  Them: We use cursor and vercel, so that's that done. Technical. I haven't got a scooby of where to start, but obviously learning by bathing in the fire, I suppose, and having these various conversations. So that's definitely a blind spot. I'd say I'm lucky that I've built up a pretty strong network over the years, just largely being early stage. You generally meet some of these vcs, like Dev, for example, at Fidel. I'm very close with them. Speaking to him tomorrow. Jeff, who's the head partner for fintech, globally for Bane. He's one of our advisors, James Olgrove as well, so we're very lucky to have some good network around us as well.  Me: You.  Them: I think, if I'm to be blunt, the most difficult one, I think, and where the blind spot lies, is probably more around the fundraising mechanics.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Is like. I understand how it works, fundamentally, right? I've seen it many times. I understand the FOMO creation, all this stuff. But it's more around. And obviously you can invest for intros, but you only want intros off people who actually have relevant, relevant touch points with people. You don't want an intro of someone who's met someone once. You want an endure for founder. He's raised 250 million and exited for a billion. You want an intro off another partner from a VC who's a personal friend or whatever else. So that's definitely one of them, I think, as we go through it. Actually how tying together that round is interesting.  Me: Yep.  Them: So, for example, we're looking at do 1.5 million pre seed GBP, that is. But there is also part of the argument which says just go raise 750k from angels, do it on a safe or an ASA or whatever else and get the money and start building. And I think that is what we're going to be doing, probably because of the traction that we've had. Because we need to deliver for these clients. We've already had some really good commitments as well from Angels. So you want to tie it up pretty quickly, like three to four weeks. But as you said, it's being methodical. It's being selective about who we speak to and why we think about Augmentum. Right. Christian reached out to, I think he's a principal just because he was in his network as opposed to any other reason. Obviously, there are Series A fund. They're not going to do pre seed and seed, but we're having the conversation probably just more as like a hey, look. You're in our network. We reached out a while back because we're looking to see what you see as good Series A signals. We've got some great traction from Angels. We don't need your money, but thank you. No, thank you. If that makes sense.  Me: Let's pull up there, because I think that's a good. That's a good point to interject. So. So, so, yes, and I'm glad that you kind of went this way because once you said, you know, you know, we're talking to a couple of firms and this and that, and then. You brought up the Augmentum example. I thought that was a good place to dig in a little bit, because I was going to say my first question was just going to be, you know, what are you saying in the meeting, right? Typically, investors at some point in time in the meeting are going to want to ask to invest right? How are you managing that conversation? And the reason that what I ask further with that is. You know, we shouldn't. You know, we shouldn't ever be half pregnant with this stuff, right? Particularly when talking to investors because of the leverage piece. And the lack of optionality that we generally have. We always want to be signaling that we don't need them, even know that we may. And there's a FOMO piece to it. But I'm reluctant to sort of go down this sort of pop psychology route. I think it's more just sort of business process, which is to say, I would rather that you went to go and speak to Augmentum, having spoken with 35 VCS already and gotten 10 indications of verbal commits and three of them are trying to preempt you then not that. Right. So then the question is, are we doing that? Are we running a process? Are we dipping our toe in.  Them: I think. Look, totally fair question. And I'm starting to understand about more running a process, more having everything aligned, more having the intros done beforehand and moving up the funnel that way transparently. We kicked off fundraising last week. The first two days we had 100k committed from angels.  Me: A. Minute.  Them: We are now trying to move as fast as possible to close these clients out. Who do I speak to last week versus Speed Inverse, who was inbound? I spoke to Octopus, who I've known for a while, Lightspeed Ventures, but mainly Angels. And I think this week I have quite a few people. If I'm honest from an investor perspective. I'm speaking to seed camp. I'm speaking.  Me: I'm enjoying you guys. Talk to me about the international ambitions of the business. Is it always going to be a uk?  Them: To 13 books. No, I'll start UK EU and then go to the us. The US is a bit more of a saturated market, so I don't want to start there. Additionally, I think moving to the US is not an easy thing to do and I think you have to be really laser focused of it. I've seen Fidel fail. I've seen Monite fail. It's not an easy feat. And it should be driven by demand. Not just because of. In my opinion, just because you think it's the biggest market and it's going to be where you make your money. You move with a customer who's multinational. From the EU or the uk, you don't go. Okay. We're going to stick some boots on the ground, spend 500k on GTM and see what happens. That's not effective, but that is what every single fintech that I've seen do generally to go to the US and backfire pretty quickly unless they do it the right way.  Me: Yeah. The question was more. I don't disagree, but my question was more around from an investor.  Them: Have we spoken to us footons?  Me: Well, it's from an optics perspective, right? Like. Yeah, you will agree with me that the US funds are more founder friendly than the EU funds, I would say.  Them: Yeah, they take an easier, quicker decision. Right. We're speaking to a couple of US angels, like Levi King from nav, a guy called Kevin who was SH Financial. So.  Me: I think institutions will struggle without a us. They will always want a us. Top co or unparent US parent. So that's just where I was going with this.  Them: I want to do a Delaware flip is the question. I'm assuming.  Me: That's what we just did. Yeah, like we've done that with Ryan, for example.  Them: Depends. It ultimately depends if they want, like, I'm obviously not going to do it unless Sequoia or a 16Z or someone goes, yeah, we'll invest 3 million at your precede.  Me: Yeah. Which requires us to obviously have conviction about speaking with US investors, which requires us to invest.  Them: Us is a lot easier for this story if I'm honest, having spoken to us customers over the years. Because there's Melio out there, there's Bill. Com, there's a shit ton of financial operations. Softwares out there, so they get it more. In the US there's bill pay with card, which doesn't exist in Europe. There's loads of different stuff which makes the US conversations easier.  Me: In.  Them: It's just a question of having the intro is like, one of my friends is a partner at CMT Digital. They're crypto blockchain. Focus.  Me: Won't be about the intros. It's about. It will be about. Because to take the money, you would need to have some indication that there's some stuff going on in the U.S. right?  Them: We have a US signed client already.  Me: There needs to be a real component to the story that is sort of you've really sat down and committed to internally and thought about. Right. So just. Anyway, that's just like a sort of a one, one. One question mark. I would have something for you to think about. The other one was on you mentioned timing. So should we just prioritize getting cash in the bank now on a safe? Make it easy, you know, give the terms to people and then get building and then, you know, come back later or run in parallel or whatever? So a few things for me that I would want to know there would to. To figure out. You know what I think with regards to that? Because as you say, there's perfectly viable paths, both of them. And I think, you see, it comes back to the round size as well. Like the one and a half. Like, I just think that it's small, you know, like we have. And again, it's Europe. It's not small for it's. It's small. It's, it's, it's. UK versus US really is the comparison I'm making. But, you know, we, we have the point of view that. You can't see the future, and so what? Your first funding round or you need any funding round, because ideally, you're not having to do this more than 3, 4, 5 times in your career under this, under this umbrella. So we don't really have many excuses to go and talk to the market organically. So when we do, we. We kind of want to get everything we can out of it. And our opinion is that you can't see the future, you can't buy yourself more time, and essentially, every round, every time you're asking for money. It is in order to underwrite the amount of time you need to get to the next round. But you don't know how long that's going to be, because shit happens, as we all know, right? So surely it is, it is in your interests from one perspective to think about, to always optimize for more time. Right now, of course, you have to balance that with dilution, and of course, you have to balance that with the market dynamics of investors here versus investors there and all that stuff. But just sort of just a general General Point of bullet point one I'd make, and then I'll go to the next one.  Them: Cools. Cool.  Me: Is just. I. I would think about trying to raise more.  Them: I don't disagree with you. Two things. As an individual, I understand VCapat businesses. I also understand profitable real businesses. Right, and real exits for real money. How many founders actually ultimately exit for actual money where they can go retire? Not many. Even though they all raise billions of dollars. Right. And that's just a blunt, cynical opinion that I have.  Me: Business. Es.  Them: Because I'm yet to see it, right? I've seen multiple billion dollar valuation companies, but apparently the founders still need to work, right? And I think I don't want to start just giving away huge dilution and control into vcs who I don't know well enough. I don't understand what their thesis is. I don't understand how they work. And I think that's why we've been very deliberate on our co. Founder relationship. I don't see much like vcs. Having a co founder be a technical skill set gap, if that makes sense. Obviously we could go out and find a technical co founder, but I want someone who's a ride or die and that's exactly the same. If I was going to take institutional money, how I would think about if that makes sense. And I think raising 3 million is absolutely possible. But the first hurdle you're going to run into is where's technical co founder? You're trying to build an AI and a gentic and I'm not going to bring on a technical co founder. Give away 10% of the business because that's not how my entrepreneurial brain works.  Me: So let's talk about. Let's talk about that quick. So. So. Because. Because you're exactly right. You won't get a dollar.  Them: And I don't think.  Me: It will be a materially different conversation between investors. Post team sort of balance, if you want to call it that, with a technical person. Co founder. With them without one. I can guarantee you that. 100%. You know, not 100%, but a lot of the initial feedback will be like, yeah, it'll be great to see a technical co founder and then they'll start to matchmake and put you in touch and all this stuff. But what's your point of view on that? How urgently or not do you need one?  Them: The first hire. We will hire as a founding engineer. We're not bringing on a technical co founder.  Me: Understood?  Them: As blunt as that gets, I'm not doing it. I don't need to give someone 10% of the business to get a technical skill set. That's as simple as this gets. And unlike every single VC out there, and also almost every single. Founder in the fintech industry have been lucky enough to see what co founders actually look and shake out like over 30 years. And I say that with utmost respect for them all and everyone included, if they can tell me when they've seen a co founder of a business taking million pounds out of a business when someone's been sectioned under the Mental Health act and think about trust and how long these relationships last for. I would love to hear from them, but all they think about is a technical co founder as being a skill set gap. I think about a co founder being someone who you ride or die who you're going to build. Real meaningful businesses with and not just go, here's 10% because you've got a skill set in AI.  Me: Yeah. Okay? So? So. Okay, so. So back to round size. So the other. The other thing. The other thing linked to. So, so, you know, you were talking about. Phasing. And speed to go and get the money in. And, you know, could you just hoover up some angel checks and then, you know, move from there? You can understand now why my brain then went to. Round size, composition of round. And then sort of, you know, you interjected with the team piece, which then made me want to examine that briefly to see if it's a blocker there. But it seems like we have a story around that which, you know, may or may not fly, but seems okay for now. In terms of the pacing and the speed. So, like, one thing. One thing that we love to. Always point out because. It might not go unnoticed, but obviously vcs love to talk about. Momentum traction. You know, they want to feel like your thing is the hottest thing. Well, you know, one of the inputs into momentum is obviously time. Right. So to the extent that we can own the time input and make the time horizon with which they evaluate us as short as possible, Then, of course, it makes the progress look as high a percentage wise as possible because suddenly your time horizon is shorter.  Them: Yeah.  Me: So what that translates into, and you're into this point is you have to be wary. You have to balance what you're doing against the perception in the market. That you may have been out in market for three or six months already. Right.  Them: Of course.  Me: So, you know, if you're taking these, these angel checks. Now, let's just play this through, right? Like, you take, you know, a million in angel checks. Now 10 million uncaps, 10 million safe, right? 10 million, cap. That then gets you going and you start to build some stuff and you heads down, you know, you kind of not really speaking with that many institutions or any institutions or whatever. And then maybe end of Q1. You know, early Q2, you start to pick your head up. You start talking to them. Start stuff to heat up. You start to heat stuff up, maybe toward a summer. Or just pre summer sort of institutional event. Purely in that scenario. I know that I would like to, I think, like, you know, if my business was incorporated on April1 and not Jan1. Then my momentum suddenly looks much stronger. When it comes to report this purely as a hypothetical example, I'm just trying to illustrate the point. Meaning. It comes back to conviction. Right? Like in an ideal world. In a purely ideal world, you do it all in one go. Right? So the angel checks that you get, you. You get your verbal commitments up to a certain point. You know, maybe. Maybe with your angels you're talking about, you know, maybe we'll do a save, just make it easy for you guys. But you then show up to your tier 3 VC conversations with your million in verbal commits that you can reference, right? You parlay that into a, you know, a couple of follow, you know, commitments to follow from vcs. But you just need a lead, right? And then you go to your leads with most of the pieces set. And then it's making it as easy for the lead as possible. To do that. You know, compressed, you know, requires a bit of planning and a bit of orchestration and a bit of all those other things. That's one route you can do. And I say, I say it's the ideal route for me personally, just as Elliot, listening to this 40 minute conversation that we've had to take it for what it is. It's just one it minimizes the risk of sitting on the shelf perception, whether it's right or wrong, and manages stuff around.  Them: Yeah. Transparently. We've been out in market for what, not even seven days?  Me: Yeah. Right.  Them: We've planned it. We've gone and signed $40,000 ARR. With no product and a prototype, which the reason we did that is because to give conviction as commercial founders, right? Majority of people at Precede have signed no revenue. All have been running the business for over a year's time and building the product as technical or product co founders. We started on this journey late November. We incorporated late November. We have half a million in pipeline. We're speaking to the biggest two biggest. Well, the biggest payments platform for SMBs in the UK and the biggest bank for SMBs in the UK. So that was the first port of call. Right. Which is to dull down this whole like, where's your technical co founder? That was why we did it that way. And now I think, as you're alluding to when we're going out, we now want that conviction. So I think you're right in terms of kind of it needs to be well planned. I think that's something that we I wouldn't say failed on, but not done as well as necessarily we thought was needed. But I think.  Me: You got a lot the website like, you know, it sounds like. It sounds like your problems more how to maximize and how to remove downside from even appearing right. Rather is managing downside. Which is? Which is already. You're already in a nicer spot.  Them: Yeah, exactly. I think we're starting to have the conversations with the funds who are relevant, probably, which is preceding seed. Right. There's no point talking to people outside of that scope because it never goes anywhere, or it's a bit wasted time, or it's a bit of an uphill battle. But as you said, it's bringing in those angel checks. Early doors and actually getting the money in on the safe building executing and then in six months time going, hey, who wants to do a five million pound round?  Me: Yeah. You know as. Maybe. Maybe. I wonder whether the institutional piece can be done. You know, at the same time. The question is, then, do we need it? You know, feel like you're giving up.  Them: What's a VC really going to bring at this stage? Genuinely, and I say that with respect for them. But are they going to bring intros into people? No. Are they going to bring additional advisors? Probably not. Are they going to bring strategic business focus in mind that we can't get from advisors or angel operators?  Me: They should bring business, right? That's the only reason we would bring them into the cap.  Them: No.  Me: Tain.  Them: Correct.  Me: To business. They are out there, right? I mean, QED. My last company, Oculus, we got from about zero to about 8 million. ARR. So purely off the back of that QED portfolio company.  Them: Yeah, of course.  Me: So. So, you know, that would be that that's the only reason that we would sell a slice of our company to them. But agreed that it's more a function of if we have a million or we have 3 million, what's the difference? What's the 2 million do for us? Right? Like that's what you need to go away and think about. Is is the to the tomb. Is the. Is the institutional slug of this. You know, like, you know, it sounds like you don't feel like you need it, but I feel like there's maybe some assumptions going into that.  Them: The assumptions are largely based on. Right. And this is our unfair advantage. And I think it's on slide four, right? Two and a half thousand platforms. We've spoken to or I have individually for the last four years about why they need these finops. Softwares inside their platforms to win in the SMB space for retention churn and everything else. I have sold to many of those platforms and have the conviction in it at this stage. I genuinely don't see many platforms in that space that I could speak to in Europe, UK or US who I didn't over the three and a half four year period. And dilution by bringing in 3 million at pre seed on what 25% would just not be something I would entertain.  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Don't get hung up on the three or the. Whatever. It's just a. You know, bigger or smaller, I guess. Right. But, like, I guess it goes back to then. You know, we are raising now in some fashion in order to do what? And the what here is in order to build the product. Right. Because we don't yet have something. So then the question is. Does the extra, you know, what is the maximum amount of money that we need to raise? Currently in order to propel us as fast enough through that goal into the next goal. Right. Like, after building. The next goal. It has to.  Them: I think it's. And that's why we chose this one and a half million. Right? It's not going to cost us a lot to build the product. It's not going to cost us a huge amount for sure. Obviously it needs to be good. But if we can start bringing in real arrange your lovables of the world and all these people. Who can actually start bringing in that much ARR that early on. As an infrastructure play. I don't think there's that many people. So that's the important thing. If we signed One of these SMB platforms, not saying we will, but the POC one for the payment provider, they got 500,000 SMBs. If 10% of them use it and they pay us £3 per agent. We will have a huge ARR very quickly and move towards profitability.  Me: Yeah, right. At which point you don't need the VC manual, right?  Them: Correct.  Me: But. But so, so help me understand. The goal, so. Okay, understood. So the goal. I mean, that's. That's a nice story to tell the VC, too, because, you know, again, if you don't need them, They want you more. Okay. It's been a really interesting conversation, man. I just realized that. I realized Elliot for my next one. Maybe we can chat more later on this. Tomorrow or something, maybe.  Them: Yeah. Let's chat more later on tomorrow. I've got to run to this call as well. But catching with you soon. Let me know if you need anything. Thank you for the advice on a memo. We did speak to a very interesting VC this morning who led the precede of one of our design partners, so I'm actually going to send that across to them later. So thank you for the advice on the memo, but let's put us in some time later today.  Me: Okay? Yeah.  Them: Oh, not today. Later. Tomorrow.  Me: Y. Eah. Let's do that. And I can send you some draft memos. I mean, just 10 seconds on that. It's just they have to write them themselves. You know, this is a shortcut. It's also a good use of practice for you to, you know, get your head in the way that they think.  Them: Yeah. If you can send a couple of those, because I'm planning on literally sending in the next half an hour, so let me know.  Me: Okay, mate. Nice one. All right, talk soon.  Them: All right. Thanks. Bye. Bye.
