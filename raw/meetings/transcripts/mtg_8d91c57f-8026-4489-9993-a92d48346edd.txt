 Them: He's said that the only times he's really runt. He personally has run into issues is around market size. So I read that as like. All right, well, let's not hang him out to dry one more time. Let's actually. Got it. Okay, cool. I think we have a pitch. It's not for Jordan. It's just.  Me: I think the other strand to that is that obviously, the market hasn't quite been built yet. Right. Either. Right. So it's like you want to talk about kind of what it is today, but how it's been growing and such, and therefore what the end result might be in five, ten years.  Them: Like. Yeah. Yeah, correct. The way I, the way I've been breaking it down right now is like, look, guys, there's two things happening at the same time. Number one, there's a trillion dollars in fixed seat based pricing SaaS. The trillion dollars in that, that does not make sense anymore. I believe in agentic two way directional payments are coming. But even right now that trillion dollars needs a way to price. Right now our first wedge already serves that which is a trillion dollar issue when it comes to pricing, right on our 4%. That means we can make of course a lot of money, right? $40 billion. Opportunity on revenue.  Me: Come here.  Them: Just on that piece, let alone the fact that there's a bunch of services businesses that are now going to have software components. So instead of making software for a law firm, law firms are just going to have are going to be AI forward, which means their pricing is going to change. So with those two combined things, there's a very large market. Like, that's really how I'm like, walking and handholding it. But the real simple one, small, small addition. Right. Let's not talk about current market size in the math. Yeah, let's talk about future. So we have to assume that, like, we're not going. Yeah. Yes, we will eat that piece. But the total market 10x that right. So it's not 40 billion of, like, potential profits, it's just 40 in that one category of 400 billion revenue that we're going.  Me: The constraint to growth right now, Mitchell, is that you don't exist.  Them: Correct.  Me: That's why it's not going faster. Right. Like, you're the growth enabler for it. You're not capturing what's already there and hoping it's going to grow. You're going to enable the category.  Them: Yeah, yeah. Correct. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So rewind. Here's really what it is. Most estimates have this market ending at about $4.5 trillion by 2030. Just so you guys understand, though, we're not waiting around for that. There's a trillion dollars in SaaS money right now that's on the wrong type of pricing. And founders tell me this every single day, seat based pricing. Doesn't make sense when you're building agents. The reason why is if you build a really good agent, you fundamentally need less seats.  Me: Perfect.  Them: So there's a trillion dollars. We need to get onto the right pricing. Now, that means There's a $40 billion opportunity today, but an upward of $100 billion opportunity going towards the future. 400. 400 billion. 400 billion or 400 billion dollar. There we go. Cool. All right. I'll lay it on thick. But I'm. It's also true if we are successful. Correct. We will grow the market. How much? We have no idea. So we're just going to say a lot. Correct. Great.  Me: Can you just do the perception? Just do the 4%. Y. Eah. Just say, look, if by 2030this thing is expected to be if at 2030this thing is expected to be at this level, then do the 4% math that you were doing on that 2,030 number, not on.  Them: Ship it. All right, let's do it. Y. Eah, I got you.  Me: Because we're investing in a five year horizon here anyway, so let's see what at the end of the thing looks like.  Them: Y. Eah, exactly. But they're all. They're not on five, they're on seven. Right. Which is great. Yeah. From this. This check at this moment as a seven year check. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's like 2033. That we're sort of, like, telling us. Yeah, yeah. And. Okay, cool. So I think that's, like, the main thing. There was, like, just making sure I understood the market size question there. From your talk with Jeff, any. Anything on his psychology? Like, I'm. I really just want to try to figure out how much we can nail the psychology of everyone not named Jordan and Nikhil, who. I think are friendlies at this point. Well, so number one, ask questions early on. Pick a random per pick Jeff, and just say, hey, Jeff, do you have any questions? Or whatever? Because the moment you do that and you establish that you will call out people either on a zoom or not, everyone will start to pay attention because you might say they're. If you don't do that, a lot of times you'll see 30% of the room drop off. It's also the people who, like, they're not really mostly decision makers, etc. But you still don't want that. You still want to, you know, hold tension of the room. If you Yeah.  Me: It's pretty baller. Hey, John, you've been quiet. What do you make of this?  Them: Correct. So I think that, that because we don't care about Jordan's questions, he, he will get in a question or get in a comment when he wants to get in. This is like his committee that he's called. But we, we do want to try to, as you said, unearth the concerns that have not been spoken about from people not named. Correct. Jordan. Jordan, Nikhil. Like if we go in here. And the other thing that like I hate too. I like they made me put together a slideshow. I hate using slides. It's just always makes your everything so much less dynamic. But you know, you got to do what you got to do.  Me: Again. You don't have to.  Them: Don't just start talking and then as it slides in later. Oh, for sure.  Me: My thing. Guys, I've got some slides. You asked me to put them together. I'm not really a huge fan. I'm just dogmatically plowing through stuff. So I'm going to have them here on the screen, but we're just going to chat and I'll throw stuff up. When we need.  Them: Correct. That is what. That is what I'm going to do. Like, I'm going to give the whole entry to the pitch before I even go through slides, right? Because the whole thing is, it just takes away what is a really, really good conversation and my ability to be a fundraiser.  Me: Yeah.  Them: And so.  Me: So limits the questioning that. Because people are going to think I'll just wait until you address it in the slides or whatever, right?  Them: Correct. Exactly right. And we. We don't want to do that. So I'm going to do the kind of. What I do is I call it hitting the B button. So I blank out this, the presentation. You can't even look at it. And it's just, you got to listen to me talk for a second, and then it's like, I'll give the beginning, and then, you know, I can go through, you know, all the whatever shit, right? Like, so the other. The other thing to do at the end of the conversation is, like, ask them about their most successful engagement. Yeah. What is success like? What has been your partnership with the most successful companies in your portfolio? It's an open ended question. The senior guys love to talk about that. They eat that at the end. Right. Because it's just perfect. And they're now connect and now mentally they're connecting you to that company. Right. If we can get them talking about what what worked well at Rain or with their engagement or when they got involved. Got it. You know, those are all, like, great topics as well.  Me: Yeah, really, It's a sub Question is like, what do we need to look like to be a top 10% company for you guys? What does that look? What's the anatomy of that? And then you get talking about, oh, well, we need to see this much growth or we need to. That's the good stuff that we need to know about.  Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Correct. It's also good, like, how. How what's your current aum? Right? Because whatever their current aum is times five is what they're trying to return at the end of. Right. And so if it's 3 billion, right, like, you know, then we know that like at the end of the day, they're going for a 15 billion dollar portfolio, exit size. And so of that for us to be significant, we need at least a billion. Yeah, exactly. Which means that we need a total enterprise value. Of 10. Right. So we need to tell it 10 billion dollar story in order for them to, like, you know, feel like it's worth to get into their top, you know, category.  Me: Come. Here. Come here.  Them: Correct. Got it. Okay, so that's helpful. So I think, I think I hear the main things that we can that I need to touch on right now, make sure that, like, everyone knows it's early. I mean, they're going to ask me questions about revenue and all of those things, and I think I need to. I want to make sure I kind of work with you guys on that one, which is so. That's just week over week growth. Got it. We're month over month growth. Don't talk in absolutes, you know.  Me: You view it as a lever that you can pull, right? It's growth versus cost efficiency. So at the moment, right now, you're investing in heads down, build growth usage. The revenue lever is what? Something we can pull wherever we need to, Right? Like pathway is there, but right now that's not the focus.  Them: Yeah. Y. Eah. Got it. Like, for me, I would just pick your KPI and whatever question they ask, go back. But the KPI is growing 20% week over week or the KPI throwing, you know? Correct. Yeah. So orgs is that for us, it's like, hey guys, we care about orgs on our platform and org is somebody who's using either our Lava build product or our Lava monetize. Right. Like that is that we think that is the best sign of health. We, similar to stripe in the era before us, are going to grow with our companies. Right. Like, and just like explain like that is what that looks like, which is why. But again, this is where we started. This is where we start. Right. We're going towards starting with. Right. Because you know, we're going to. Exactly. We're starting with blank because the world pay is like also the later on, you know, part of the. The art. Correct. And that's how I told the story that. That's how just. To be clear, I told the story to Jeff. I was like, look, he started here because you have to get as much early adoption as you can because you never know how big those companies are going to be. Correct. But over time, you know, the problem migrates from something that you know, somebody you know has a pressing point. Now as a brand new company and some company that's 10 years old who finally, like, comes around and realizes that it's correct. Correct.  Me: Now, you need to have a point of view on revenue. That answer in isolation isn't good enough. Like someone can say, well, yeah, sure, but where are you with actually talking to people about stuff?  Them: Yeah. Yeah, they already. They already asked about pipeline and all that stuff. And I tried to hold off as long as I could, and I told. I shared our, like.  Me: Okay? It's not about holding it off. It's making sure they understand it's not the focus. But you nevertheless need to have the answer to the question right as well.  Them: Correct. Correct. Correct. And. And, you know, that's, like, pretty clear. Like, I know all I did was just back into, like, okay, if we were raising, quote, quote, a series B in two years or in one year, what does that need to look like? And then, like, try to roughly backing it in from there.  Me: Okay? Yeah.  Them: Is, like, kind of how I did it. Like, usually the way I try to do it is like, okay, they're technically coming in at what is it going to be, like a seed plus check. What should feel aggressive for them is I should be at a. Like, what would make them really happy is if they still get to think of this like a series, a play, but that they're getting priced up in the next, what would be two years. Right? It's like, usually how I think about it. And so then I just try to back into my numbers from there. Meaning, like, okay, we'll add a series B. What revenue do you usually need to be at for that? Right? And it's like, okay, and then trying to obviously think about it in a. Sense of, like, AI has kind of made everything wonky because you have these AI companies that are at $100 million in one year and like that in two years and stuff like that. They're all pilots. It's all pilots. Terrifying. It's all pilot. And it's also. The other thing is. It's not like the beautiful part about this business. This is just payments at the end of the day. It's like if you're. If I'm making real money, it's because the business under me is making real money moving through their system. It's not like a one time contract. We don't really get one time contracts on our product. So I do find it hilarious that these founders think it's a good idea to take whatever $50 million of pilots. And then presented as ARR. Yeah, it's crazy. And then sell that to the investors. It's like, oh, man. The other issue is it's not even. The other issue is it's not even $50 million of pilots. It's like 5 million, 10 million. And then they're run rating it, so they're saying it's 10 run. Rated app. Whatever. Yeah, we're going to do. We're going to do one of these every month. Oh, my God. It's like, oh, my. Oh, my God. And then get the round done. Correct. If my goal was to steal money, that's what I would. Yeah, it's like, it'll get. The round done, but then it's like you've just made. Okay. I just enjoy the turn. Enjoy the turn and the roller coaster of the startup too.  Me: I mean, it seemed to work. It seemed to work out okay for Harriet Pipe.  Them: It's what I'm saying, though. Some people, if they. If they. If they. If they know what game is being played, they never hire anyone.  Me: So, Mitchell.  Them: Wait. Pipe. Didn't they. Didn't they fit really quickly? I thought they. They crashed and burned. Well after the founder did secondaries.  Me: Yeah, he took out all of the money.  Them: Sorry. I went back to what you were saying.  Me: Never been seen again.  Them: Yeah, well, let me do it. Like 60 million bucks. I understand. He would never want to be seen again.  Me: It was a money. He's a young guy in Miami with all that money and no repercussions. So, Mitchell, you asked about Jeff specifically? Matt said something recently that I stayed with me, that I thought maybe if he hasn't brought up with you as an idea, maybe I just wanted to float it just real quick, which is like, if you can find something out unique about Jeff, that he'd be surprised that you. Knew that you can just drop in and he'll be like, how the fuck? How did you know? And you can be like, so and so told me that you guys do this or that or whatever. It's just like. Again, just like a little funny little like, this guy's a smooth operator. He did the. Legwork.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Me: And it just makes you stand out again a little bit more.  Them: Yeah. Okay, so he went to Dartmouth and Stanford. I'm looking at it right now. But, like, at a minimum, if you just mention, you know, the Admeld connection. Like that's that. That's enough. But you might be able to take it further, as Elliot saying, if you on him slightly. And then can you? Yeah, well, I guess the question is. Let's look at there real quick. Yeah, that's what I'm doing. Committee. Why? Do they not know how to build websites? They just can't. Dude, it's like, just feed it to Claude code at this point, like, Jesus Christ, what a horrible pop up. Just, just. Also, there's such a legacy fund. In some ways, it's, like, actually funny. For sure. Yeah. I mean, I really think that I don't see anybody else besides Jeff as a senior guy.  Me: Crazy. Like, selection of things he sat on. Boy, he's been on the board of, like, lending club. Turn. Weird. Diverse. What is Norway, Steele? It's like a fund. Like what is their focus?  Them: I mean, honestly, come from it. Yeah, I was gonna say. Who? I think it's Northwestern Mutual.  Me: Yeah, that would make sense. But.  Them: Here, let me use my. Let me use my. I have a. I have a. I have a Claude project that just gives me insights on a vc. Perfect. Give me a second. I'm gonna need a copy of that. Yeah, I can give you the prompt. It actually is so clean, I just feed it before I walk into. Any meeting, like fund name and the investor I'm talking to, it gives me the information on that investor. It also gives me the fund if they've made any competitive bets, all of that stuff. Oh, it's wells fargo. Oh, yeah. I knew it was one of those. It was like a big. Jeff. That's funny because, like, there's so much more successful than the Wells Fargo VC Group.  Me: Also, they seem to be doing. They seem to be doing a lot of consumer stuff.  Them: Yeah, I know. Yeah.  Me: Which is not really. Anything to do with Wells Fargo.  Them: Oh, no, I think that it so it. It sounds like the origin is like Norwest was a thing and it merged. With norwest corporation. Merged with Wells Fargo in 98. And it had. A. Yeah, full banking. In Alberta, of all places. The norwest equity partners is the pe arm. Which is also partly so. He joined Norwest in 04. Jeff's did. Managing partner, 2013 co founded Edify Corporation 1990-99. Previously coo at dove bird. Dove bid Stanford 6 consecutive appearance on the Forbes Midas list. Yeah. He's done well. Yeah. Current boards include abode button, common x toll, homeward honeybook icon, learn to win madden reed minted nanopath, praxis labs. Tv, scientific wisc notable exits uber, Spotify, opendoor, plaid fair, jet lending club, admeld, jigsaw. Investment style. Jeff has strong operator values and founder relationships over rushed processes. He's described his philosophy as avoiding series AB rounds that feel like shotgun weddings prefer founders and investors spending time testing each other before committing Q1 2025. He noted that without positive exits, venture investors are focusing more on supporting existing port cos and have less appetite to make new investments. So, like, that's how I was like, whoa. Is there anything that we can do with Wells Fargo? I mean, like, if I layer on, like, a fun story. Sure, yeah. Like, we can. We can make it up. I mean, I think that the thing would be. It's like here does, well, process payments. Is there a story I can tell on why we would. Be valuable. To Wells, who, from my understanding, is their lp. Let's see here. Claude is ticking. Here, I'll send you guys the prompt I used for this, but just add it to if. Whether you guys use GPT or Claude, it actually works pretty well. We've switched to really doing most of our work through Claude at this point, but Claude person these days, yeah.  Me: Yeah.  Them: It's. It's. It's pretty.  Me: I use them both for different things. I tend to use GPT. I tend to use GPT to be the devil's advocate. Review board. I work in Claude, so I like export handover from Claude into GPT and tell GPT to be brutal.  Them: Same. Yeah.  Me: And then that stuff back to Claude.  Them: Y. Eah. It's actually. It's actually pretty. It's. I'm going to put into a Google Doc for you.  Me: But it's useful. It's useful that way, Burton, because GPT doesn't have the kind of tunnel, sort of vertical, deep but narrow context window that you're working in in Claude with your item. So it's sort of like throwing a deep but narrow versus horizontal.  Them: Yeah. Correct. And I think the killer thing about that you. You mentioned, the main thing is context. Like, Claude has all the context of our entire code base, and I can use that in Claude itself. And so it actually foundationally understands how our product works and, like, what things engineers were like, what things certain people were like. And I'm messaging you guys.  Me: It's not going to remember that on a persistent. Like, it's. It's going. It's going to have to teach yourself that with every session, though.  Them: No, not if you use a project. Projects pull from the same source of information every time.  Me: Right. But some of the things that go, well, my understanding is what power is a project, of course, the stuff you've uploaded into it, but, you know, that has a capacity on it and it's now to do that fetching where it sort of caches it and in the background, but there's these. Three or four MD files, right? Like, those are the main things and like that.  Them: Correct. Correct. Y. Eah.  Me: That. That's the persistent. That's like the bios, right? Like, that's.  Them: Yes. The beautiful thing though with code is most of the weightiest files you don't actually need to give it context on. So you just specify in your GitHub which files you actually want it to ever look at. Which is like your core, like non weighty files, which almost always files that take up a bunch of space. So, like UI UX files. Like, you don't need to know what the design of that. Like, you don't. It doesn't need to see that thing. And so.  Me: Right. Right, right, right. Yeah. Yeah. So you're saying that you. You within the MD files, you have your GitHub linked and further places for it to look and so then it will go and get that as it reloads every time.  Them: Correct. But context management is a problem. Like it is. It is certainly there is a. We need a layer. We just need a context layer on top. We. There's certainly a startup to be had in like the context layer.  Me: I know. Well, I. Now tell it. So, you know, I've learned so much about all these things, but, like, you know, like semantic drift. Right. For example. So the problem of not enough memory or sort of overwhelming the context is that basically the way that it's engineered is that it will from a user experience perspective because it wants to make you happy. Seek to provide you an answer that fits within the remaining compute and like, you know, availability of context that it has right meaning. So if you give it a massive list of stuff to start with, super in depth, massively detailed, and then as you work through it more and more, it's not going to tell you it's doing this, but it's going to be continually trimming and forgetting and pruning the initial stuff to fit what it can do back to you. And so, like, I've had to. I basically. Now, I. I can share with you, Mitch, if you like, but, like, I have, like, basically every, every. Well, I. I think I call it every breaking change that it makes to something. I basically make it, like, reset itself again. So then it comes back to the importance of the handovers, which is why I was asking about those defiles and how that.  Them: Yeah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Correct. Correct. Correct. Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah. We should. We should talk about this more. I mean, we are pretty aggressive here with using sub agents. So those like save your context window. So you have a main agent that does orchestration. So like anytime, like also, we're very systems based here. Like, we expect you to use LLMs to code. Now you're just faster. But like, there's certain things we also expect you to do in it. Like, so, for example, if you ever work with an LLM, you need to create an agent orchestration file. You need to create like, certain things that make it do the right thing. And that's preserve context. You're completely right, Elliot. Like, it's like the drift is one of the biggest issues. Really quickly, here's what it said about Wells Fargo. Interesting angle. Let me dig into Wells Fargo payments business, see if there's a strategic narrative. Yes. Wells Fargo process payments substantially. Merchant Services, full payment processing through Wells Fargo Merchant Services uses FISER as a back end processor. Cards, mobile Elliot recurring billing. So there's that issue there, as we could say. Like, look, we want, we, we don't want to be a processor right now. And, you know, one of the. Values. What you could do is, like, if you guys. I know you guys are Welsh, like. So now that I think about this, though, we should text Jordan ahead of time and just say, like, is there any linkage? Or is it pure? Like, is there's a potential to. Now that I think about, if they're the solo p. Like, sometimes they do it strategically, but sometimes they do it arm lengths away. So we go down this rabbit hole. Can you. Can you guys tell me what the message I should say for that?  Me: Suggest. To Jordan. I can just be like, hey, buddy. Like, can you. Do you have some time to jump on a quick call real quick and just play through some stuff?  Them: Yeah. Or you just text him. Hey, I saw that wells fargo is a major lp of yours. Do you guys do stuff strategically with them, or are they just an lp? Got it.  Me: That's the question you want to ask is how involved or not are they?  Them: Because. Because it looks like they're the number one ach clearer in the country. And they do one in seven cross border payments.  Me: But then I think if he says. If he says, like, yeah, yeah, super, like, you know, yes, then I would still position it as a question in the meeting.  Them: A global thing. It's actually. Correct.  Me: Hey, guys. You know, like, I'm assuming. I know that Weld is an important. And then he asked the question that you already know the answer to that starts the conversation that you want.  Them: Yeah. Here's the. Yeah, here's the def. The things it was. It also brought up the one and seven on. On mine as well. The other things it said is the global payments liquidity one is ever cross border transactions globally Treasury Management, Comprehensive cash management ach, Real time payments, rtp, Swift connectivity.  Me: Me give you a load of shit like Jordan will tell you.  Them: Yeah. So, okay, I'll send them a message and just say, hey, guys, quick question. Like, I notice you guys, I mean, one of you guys, a large lp, the large LP as well as Fargo. Is there any, you know, strategic connection there? Or is it more just they're a hands off lp, correct? Okay? Great.  Me: Yeah. Is there any. Is there anything I should add into my story about this?  Them: Exactly. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. So, like, the equivalent at QED was always, you know, to, like, talk about Capital One and, like, those connections. Yeah, I. I have a thread with them. Do you think that that's, like, inappropriate to doing an email? Like, does it need to be a text, or is it fine if I'm just. We've already been talking in a thread. No, I would just add it to the thread if you're already. Okay, great. Cool. Okay. I think these are the big things. I think we are. You know, there's a lot. To make sure we're nailing here. I mean, at the end of the day, like, you know, for me, the big thing is, it's like, you know, we've. We've done enough prep. Just got to go in there, we chat with them for a bit, and we keep moving. A couple other updates. First, Mark similarly asked, hey, can we just see everything you did at your seed? We're going to try to do a bunch of work in the background. And we, you know, because I just kind of, I went and chatted with. I didn't know Adam worked at Dropbox. So we went. We. We started. Oh, sorry. I should have done my research. Done that before the call. And so I was in the office, and we just literally spent the first 20 minutes just talking about, you know, Dropbox stories and, like, how, like. And then, like, he name dropped. Sbc. I was like, oh, I was in. Sbc, like, you know, I'm going to go to that stuff. So it was like, you know, just like, literally, like, I would get to a place, he would just leave a place. So we had a lot of connectivity there. And, you know, they asked me about the fundraising stuff and I said this, the party line, which is, guys, you know, we're not running around right now. Like, a bunch of people have been like, you know, asking us do we want to take cash, especially post stripe acquisition? And my answer has been like, if it's a great partner who makes it really easy for us to be able to keep moving. Like, we'll consider it. You know, we haven't put together materials. I'm happy to send you the stuff that we did for our last round, but, like, we don't really have anything for that. And they're like, okay, you know what we're interested in, like, just doing some research in the background. And, like, you know, can we send you all this information? Can you send us this information? And, you know, we want to kind of lean in thoughtfully that way. And then they gave me some good ideas on actually, like, effectively, like, how to maintain the usage, the usage monetization stuff and like, you know, some good stuff there. But anyway, Yeah. And I think also, too, like, you know, what Adam was is really, like, leaning towards, I think, at the moment is like, what does the future look like? Correct at the end of the day. Right. So I think a lot of that is more of, like, if just grabbing coffee and just talking about, like, even the stuff that's a little bit fuzzier in the future. You know, I was talking to Elliot over the weekend about just, like, I'm now coming to the realization that, like, if we use these AI tools to build most of our stuff, they make designs on our behalf, and, like, we should be tracking what tools the AI picks. Correct.  Me: Mitchell, you remember when you were talking?  Them: Correct. That's why. Lovable. Like, it took me a while. I was behind. Like, I'm like, no, guys, we need to figure out. There's a reason why I've been like, how do I talk to everyone at each of these? Like, if they pick us and we're the easiest one for these LLMs to implement. We're going to win. Like, I got it. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm not. I'm not cursing at you. I'm cursing out of excitement. I'm like, we're going to win if we do this right. But, yeah, it's, it's.  Me: But no, I didn't. I had the same. When Mitchell first taught me, I was like, oh, yes, we're going to buy. Like, people will buy buckets. You know, you'll buy from lovable, and then underneath that, there's a bunch of stuff that you just hope has been curated, correct?  Them: The. Dude, the engineers are still making the decision, but the engineer is now AI. So it's like, well, the engineers are just making higher level decisions. Correct. End of the day, we're just correct. But. But what I think is what was the light bulb for me was like, oh, but like, this is my entire 2010's. Over again. Like, we were the first users of Datadog, the first users of Carta, the first users of Slack, the first. You know, like, if we had just invested in the tools that we were, like, picking at the time, we would have had monster E. Yeah. Monster etf on just that.  Me: Why don't we just do that? We should just do that.  Them: Yeah, because I didn't know. I didn't know. But now it's happening again. But now the. It's the AIs that are. If you can get into Supabase, like, that's. There's a reason. That is all the stuff that we have already. Anyways. Yeah, it's. Crazy. Yeah. There. It's. It's. It's so exciting. It's an exciting time. And I think that it's like, if I get a little bit more breathing room, it's really all I want to do. Like, the only two partnership angles that I. I even have it in the slides for. Them is like the two, like I divide our GTM into really like a very pithy thing. There's a self serve Flywheel that we're getting going and then our actual time is spent partnering with legacy processors and AI coding engineer agents. And like, that is it. That is Flywheel starts going pay agents. And then. And then Long Tail is on a self serving flywheel. They get on the build, we sell them up from there like that is it. And.  Me: We're going best in super base.  Them: You know, I think the very, very. The clear observation to me is I like if you can nail that. And it actually makes a bigger argument for starting with earlier companies, because the people who use coding agents the most are small companies. It's like I'm prototyping real quick. Right, you're prototyping. Now, but whatever you use for payments processing in your prototype, you're going to use carry on in your next thing. Like, for sure. Well, especially if the agent chooses. Yeah, exactly. Right.  Me: Yeah, the vibe. Is, you shouldn't ignore, currently, at least in my personal experience, how these tools are basically just shoved in. Like it's not. I mean, you're given kind of a choice, kind of. But like, if you've been working with the LLM in a sort of way where you tell it to do the stuff, and you don't really, you know, provide opinions. It will basically just choose forward. You know, it will just.  Them: Yeah. Well, 100%. 100? Yeah.  Me: So it's. It's, you know, the sell is done at a different place for sure.  Them: 100%. Yeah. Well, it's a, it's a different sell because it's like, it's actually, like, in some ways, might be a more sophisticated buyer than humans. Well, it's also why you need content on the. That's why I'm investing content, because it's like, oh, the LLM needs. To read, and so it loves comparisons. Right? Because it just takes it as truth. So the more place we need to figure out how to, like, inject a bunch of stuff into Red yellow. Already on it. Already on it, Mike. Already on it. My EA is already. My EAs doing this. I was like, I. We have a. We have a. We have a. Remember all that stuff like Inception, modern day, it's like, you have to literally be like, oh, yeah, honestly, you know, and you can't be too obvious because in Reddit, like, obvious, the Reddit mobs, they will absolutely wreck you. And so it's, but it's, it's, it's actually wild how much this has changed. And it's been fun being so close to it, but also so like Elliot. That's the future of publishing. It's publishing to the models.  Me: He's already. Mitchell on. Mitchell. He? I remember.  Them: Yes, it's literally that.  Me: What? I was just thinking we should buy stack overflow.  Them: Oh, for sure. I think. I think it got bought. Yeah, it might already happen.  Me: It's dead, isn't it? So no art questions being asked in there anymore at all?  Them: Yeah.  Me: But, you know, like.  Them: A process for 1.8 billion. Oh, that's 21. Slack bought it.  Me: That.  Them: Y.  Me: How recently?  Them: I don't know. It's called now called Slack Internal.  Me: Yeah. I saw Chart the other day. Where it was just, you know.  Them: Yeah. Honestly, what I would have done is I would have bought it and then literally removed all access to any out.  Me: Exactly. It's a data asset.  Them: I read this wrong Pro. I think Process bought it in 21. Which honestly, if I was them, I'd shut off all access and enforce LLMs have to pay me like per per use to the data.  Me: Yeah, yeah. Correct. Data. Yeah, it's a toll booth type model for that.  Them: Is what I would do. Yeah. Yeah.  Me: That's so valuable.  Them: Yeah. Oh, I didn't realize that Process is the primary shareholder of WeChat. It's crazy. That's not good. They were just buying that just to diversify. Oh, that's. That's. There we go. That's real money. Yeah, I know. Your diversity. I think this has been the most important thing, is just really trying to go and nail this meeting, if there's any. Other things you guys think before this meeting at three.  Me: Stop it.  Them: You know, I think really other than this is just like, go in there, answer some questions, give them, give them the pitch that I've done a thousand times. Their slides. All that good this afternoon Post you getting out of this meeting. I'm going to send Jeff a note, you know, just saying I caught up with you. And then, you know, if there's an opportunity, great. If not, you know, no worries. But, yeah, I think in general, like, why don't we just touch base later today? Let's do it. Let's do it. We'll touch base today. Let's do data via text, and then tomorrow morning I'll just call you. Cool co. Ol. Okay, that's perfect.  Me: Have they? One final question. Have they spoken with any customers, Mitchell, yet, or anything like that?  Them: Yes, they have. They asked to speak to a customer. I introduced him to Catty, one of our customers.  Me: Okay? Okay? So that you don't need to sort of another one in the pocket.  Them: I wanted to. Yeah.  Me: And keep one prep.  Them: I do have another one. I have one in the pocket. It's actually going to be one that's going to be coming on board. It's called Adventure, who we're sending over contracts, actually, probably today, where the founder of it actually founded Good Music. Good Music is the record label, like he founded it. With Kanye West.  Me: Ok? Ay.  Them: And now he's making a game. Yeah. So I was like, actually, I need you to do a. I'm like, hey, probably like, I'll just discount this so much for you, but if you can just do a. Some promotion with me, that would be great. Testimonial. Yeah, just a testimonial. Would be excellent.  Me: For a bit, I think.  Them: We're steering clear of that part. But good music is like, oh, he was like. He created a major record label and, like, believes in the gaming future where the artist formerly known as Kanye west will. Will not be anywhere in any of the testimonial material. Not on the testimonial, not on the cap table. He will be nowhere near the business in any way, shape, or form. I don't even listen to Kanye, but. Yeah, but. All right, guys, well, I'm. I'm going to get off, but good. Good catching up with you guys.  Me: Yeah. Exactly.  Them: Talk soon, man. Bye.
